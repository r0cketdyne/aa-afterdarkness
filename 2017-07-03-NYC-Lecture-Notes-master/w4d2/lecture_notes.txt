HTTP Request / Response Cycle

REQUEST:
 - query string - stuff after ?
 - HTTP Method / Verb
    - GET
    - DELETE
    - POST
    - PATCH / PUT
 - Path - stuff before ?
    - www.website/users/1
 - Body - information from a form

RESPONSE:
 - Status: 3 digit code to indicate how
     the request was processed.
    Examples: 404 (not found), 200(OK)
 - Body: Data
      HTML/CSS if its a render-able website
      maybe just JSON if its just raw data

Request Processing in Rails:
  1) Router
    - Looks at Verb/Method and Path
    - Sends request to appropriate controller
  2) Controller
    - uses Models and Model methods to gather data
    - packages up response and sends it back
  3) Response goes back to client
