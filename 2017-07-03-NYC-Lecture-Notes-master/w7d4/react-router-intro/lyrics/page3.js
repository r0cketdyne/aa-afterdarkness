  <p>
    I see a little silhouetto of a man
    Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
    Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
    (Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo figaro magnifico
    I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
    He's just a poor boy from a poor family
    Spare him his life from this monstrosity
    Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
    Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
    (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
    (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
    (Let me go.) Will not let you go
    (Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah
    No, no, no, no, no, no, no
    (Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
    Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!
