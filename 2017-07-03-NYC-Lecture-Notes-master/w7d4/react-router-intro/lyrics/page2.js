  <p>
    Mama, just killed a man
    Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
    Mama, life had just begun
    But now I've gone and thrown it all away
    Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
    If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
    Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

    Too late, my time has come
    Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
    Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
    Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
    Mama, ooh, (any way the wind blows)
    I don't want to die
    I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
  </p>
