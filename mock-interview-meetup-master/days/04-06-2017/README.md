### Agenda

* 10 minutes: Each person tries to solve the problem they are about to administer without looking at the solution (Write out solution either on paper or on laptop)
* 5 minutes: If problem has not been solved, read through the solution.
* 35 minutes: Partner A interviews B
* 5 minutes: Debrief
* 35 minutes: Partner B interviews A
* 5 minute: Debrief

#### If you get done early
Test each other on these two questions that one of our grads was recently asked at an onsite:
1. Implement the singleton pattern, then adapt it to make a “doubleton” where each read operation alternated in returning one of the instances. Finally, write some unit tests for the doubleton.

2. Write `JSON.stringify` using vanilla JS. `myStringify` should take in anything and output that anything as a string.
