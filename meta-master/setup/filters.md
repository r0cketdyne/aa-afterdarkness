# Email filters for GitHub
The entire App Academy curriculum is hosted on GitHub, and it's always under development. The frequent edits mean that it's the most up-to date-copy! This also means that you can get a *lot* of email notifications. Really, a *stunning* amount. If you want to turn the volume down on these, you can, without missing other notifications from GitHub. I use Gmail, which is great with filtering, so that's what I'll document. Here's how! 

1. Add an alternate email address to GitHub. Go to [email settings,](https://github.com/settings/emails) and add, say, `(your usual email)+aa@gmail.com` - Gmail delivers it to you, but lets you filter on the `+aa` bit.

2. Send AA-specific email there. Go to [Notification Center.](https://github.com/settings/notifications) Check out Custom routing, at the bottom. Send AA notifications to the new email.

3. Filter on that, in Gmail. You've got that part, right?

4. Add another filter, Has the words: list:"appacademy.github.com"
