# Diversity and Culture in Tech

This is a heavy reading. These topics and ideas can land very differently on different people. Please approach this with an open mind and take it seriously.

### Goals of This Reading
  * Acknowledge the breakdown of diversity in tech
  * Understand the problems that the tech community faces
  * Understand App Academy's official stance on diversity and workplace culture
  * Develop your own thoughts, opinions, and a willingness to engage in productive conversations about this topic

## Diversity in Tech

First, let's look at some data:
  * [The Breakdown p1][stats]
  * [The Breakdown p2][stats2]

## Challenges

An important part of being a great software engineer is staying informed and being involved in the tech community. Read through these articles to get a sense of some of the challenges affecting the industry and why having a dialogue about diversity and inclusion is important.
  * [How Diversity Makes Us Smarter][article1]
  * [Creating a Culture of Inclusivity][article2]
  * [Companies don't think they have a diversity problem][article3]
  * [5 Myths of Underrepresentation][article4]
  * [Empathetic Communication][article5]

You are not expected to read every article. You should at least skim each one for the major points, and spend more time reading the content you find interesting and thought provoking.

Throughout the curriculum, we will link to additional resources on a variety of topics. These resources are optional reading, and keep in mind that all articles linked represent the opinions of their authors. A couple articles each week are bolded; these are the ones we recommend if time is an issue.

Additionally, App Academy holds regular diversity and inclusion round tables throughout the cohort to give everyone a chance to discuss the ideas within these readings. We encourage everyone who's interested to come have an open discussion about these topics.
