# Strike Policy

App Academy holds students accountable to their agreement to uphold their
academic integrity using a system of strikes.  This system is split into two
phases: coding curriculum strikes and job search curriculum strikes.  The
Coding Curriculum is comprised of the first nine weeks of the program; the Job
Search Curriculum begins in Week 10, right after the conclusion of the Coding
Curriculum.   

### Coding Curriculum Strikes

During the Coding Curriculum, you will be assessed strikes for any of the following behaviors:

- Lateness or absence at any of the 3 daily check-ins (in the morning at 9am, after lunch, typically at 1:30pm, and after the afternoon break, typically at 4:30pm),
- Failure to submit your daily report on Progress Tracker,
- Having a device such as your phone, laptop, etc., out during instructional hours (9am-6pm Monday-Friday, not including breaks),
- Other rule violations at the discretion of the App Academy instructional staff.

You may accumulate up to 10 strikes during the Coding Curriculum.  Accumulating
10 or more strikes is grounds for dismissal from App Academy.

### Job Search Curriculum Strikes

After the end of Week 9, your Coding Curriculum strikes will be nullified and you will be subject to the Job Search Curriculum strike system.  The following behaviors can result in Job Search Curriculum strikes:

- Lateness or absence from either of the 2 daily check-ins (in the morning at 9am and in the afternoon, typically at 4:30pm)
- Failure to respond to an email or phone call from your career coach within 1 business day,
- Missing an appointment with your career coach,
- Submitting fewer than the required quota of job applications (typically 40/week after you've been approved to apply),
- Failure to submit any Algorithms curriculum project or assignment, or submitting your assignment late,
- Leaving the job search area (SF or NYC) without the approval of your career coach,
- Failure to meet a deadline set by your career coach,
- Failure to keep [Jobberwocky](http://progress.appacademy.io/jobberwocky) up to date.

You will remain accountable to the Job Search Curriculum strike system until you
have found a job, or 1 year has passed.  Your Job Search strike count will
reduce by 1 strike a week.  You may accumulate up to 5 Job Search strikes.
Accumulating 5 or more strikes will result in a conversion of your tuition model
to a flat fee, for which you will be billed immediately.
