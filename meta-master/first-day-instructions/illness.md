# Illness

To prevent the spread of illness and accelerate your recovery, if you become ill
you should stay home. If you come to App Academy and fall ill or come in spite
of being ill, your TAs may send you home. This is necessary to protect the
health of the other students and staff.

You may miss up to 3 days of the cohort without any penalty due to illness.

To avoid incurring any strikes you must:

1. Notify your TAs in advance: `instructors-sf@appacademy.io` or
  `instructors-ny@appacademy.io`.
1. Submit your work for the day to your TA via a github link.
1. Have used fewer than 3 sick days already.
