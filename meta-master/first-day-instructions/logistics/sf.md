## [Student/Staff Resource Groups](#ssrgs)

App Academy currently has two student/staff resource groups for
communities underrepresented in tech. These groups serve as a
space for students, staff, and alums to build community and support
one another.

### Women, Trans, and Gender Non-Conforming Group

The a/A WTGNC* Group is a group of current students and alums that
offers mentorship, career guidance, and more. Our goal is to create a
supportive learning community for students and alums of marginalized
genders, including students who identify as women, trans,
non-binary, and/or gender non-conforming. We regularly host a self-paced
algorithms study group with snacks at App Academy, and occasional
meetings around the SF bay area featuring a guest speaker and
refreshments. Please send Candace (chsu@appacademy.io) an email if
you are interested in joining or would like to learn more about the
group! 

### LGBTQ Group

The LGBTQ group is for current students, alums, and staff, and is a
great place to meet and connect with other LGBTQ-identified App Academy
folks! We have a slack channel where any member can share relevant news
or events, and where we post the details of the occasional group
meet-ups. Please let Shamayel (sdaoud@appacademy.io) know if you are
interested in joining!

### Additional SSRGs

Students are welcome to form their own student/staff resource groups
that serve the mission of fostering community and support for
communities who are underrepresented in tech and/or at App Academy. If
you would like to form your own group and receive funding to host an
event, please fill out [this form][ssrg-form]!
