# Housing Options

We'll keep updating this page with affordable housing options that we come across.


## New York

These rental management places have some of our students in the past.
Tell them you’re coming from App Academy (we’re not taking
any kickbacks for advertising them so definitely to ask for a student
discount if they offer you a spot).

* Isleydys Silva: She manages a number of units in Manhattan, starting
  at $690/mo. She'll ask you to friend her on Facebook so she can check
your profile. Email isleydys@gmail.com
