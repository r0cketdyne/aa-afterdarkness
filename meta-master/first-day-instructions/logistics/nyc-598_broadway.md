    * All visitors to App Academy must be let up to the 6th floor by
      a staff member. Do not let any visitor into the office by opening the 
      elevator door, even if the visitor claims to have an appointment or a tour 
      scheduled. Ask them to kindly wait for App Academy staff to come down to 
      retrieve them. It is a safety hazard to let strangers into App Academy.

      visitor does not have an appointment with App Academy staff, they are not
      supposed to be here.
