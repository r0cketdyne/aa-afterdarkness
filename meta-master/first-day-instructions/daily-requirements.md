# Daily Requirements

## Evenings

* Review our solutions and compare them to yours. Prepare any questions for next day.
* Read next day's readings. Watch the video lectures.
* If present, do homework assignments.
* Review, but **don't** do, the exercises
  (they're for in class the next day).
* Submit your daily progress report.
* Do the daily quiz.
* If you have extra time, work on your unfinished assignments.

## Lectures

* Lectures will be a mix of traditional formal lecture and Question
  and Answer. We expect every student has thoroughly studied the 
  video lectures and readings.
* We will occasionally have code demos.
* Please come prepared with questions on yesterday's work and today's
  readings/video lectures.

## Study Halls

* A couple times per week we will have 'study halls'. These are one
  hour periods from 9am - 10am (roll call at 9am) for you to ask
  questions and seek individualized help. Make the most of these!
* Come prepared with questions from the solutions, readings,
  and previous material.

## Daily Progress Report

Submit your daily report via [progress tracker][progress-tracker], due
before 9:00AM the following day. Weekend progress reports are due 
Monday before 9:00AM.

Part of the progess report is evaluating the performance of your TAs
and lecturer. This report is sent anonymously to the TA. Please be honest
in your reports so that the staff can improve, but please keep your
feedback constructive.
