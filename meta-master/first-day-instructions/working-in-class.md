# Working in Class

## Prereqs

* Read the day's readings and watch video lectures before the start of class.
* Read the instructions for the day's exercises and projects before the start
  of class.
* Do the homework assignments if present before the start of class.
* Do NOT start the day's exercises or projects before the start of class.

## Working

* Create a folder on the Desktop named after the current day (e.g. w1d1).
* Open the Terminal and navigate to your directory.
* Run the command `atom .` to open the directory in Atom.
* Go to the README of the repo for the part of the curriculum we're in, and
  scroll to the section for the current day.
* **DO NOT REFER TO SOLUTIONS WHILE WORKING THROUGH PROJECTS**
* Go through each page, from top to bottom, doing any exercises.
* Do any projects for the day.
* If there are bonus projects and time permits, do those as well.

## Testing your Code

* When implementing the solution for an exercise or project, test the code as
  you go along.
* You can write code to test your implementation at the bottom of your file.
  * Then, in the Terminal, run `ruby name_of_your_file.rb` to execute your test
    code.
  * Pro Tip: Wrap your test code in `if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME` so it only
    runs when your file is invoked directly.
* You also can open `pry`, an interactive Ruby prompt, in the Terminal to run your
  code.
  * Make sure the Terminal is in the directory where you file of code is.
  * Run `pry`.
  * Load in your file by running `load './name_of_your_file.rb'`.
  * Run your methods to test things out.
  * When you change your code file, run the `load` command again to reload
    the changes.

## Hitting a Bug

When you get stuck on a problem, you should follow these steps:

1. Ask your partner.
2. Google your question multiple different ways.
3. If you still can't find an answer after 5 minutes or more, ask a TA for help using Progress Tracker.

## Slack

We use the chat app Slack a lot here! Use the group for your cohort to discuss
coding issues, solutions, projects, technologies, places to eat, etc.

## Forking Repositories

* Don't fork the repositories!

## Disability Accommodations

If you have a disability for which you need an accommodation, please notify the
head instructor of your campus. App Academy will do everything it can to provide
reasonable accommodations within the structure of the course.
