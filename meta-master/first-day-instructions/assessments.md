# Assessments and Advice

## Assessments

* Assessments are intended to give you early feedback so you know
  whether you are keeping up.
* Assessments are given the first several Mondays, in class. They
  usually take about an hour.
* Assessments are done solo. You're not allowed to reference previous
  code, notes, or the internet.
* Assessment material contains no surprises; we'll give a practice
  assessment the weekend before each real assessment.
* Do not cheat on the assessments. Students have been caught cheating in the
  past, and they have been dismissed from the course. There is nothing at all to
  be gained by cheating; your success in the job search will depend on your
  mastery of the material, and not on your "grades" (which we don't give out
  in any case). A student who struggles on a couple of assessments will be more
  employable than one who cuts corners by cheating. Take this to heart.
* Do not create/use custom 'snippets' beyond what is built into the
  text editor. Custom snippet usage on assessments will be considered
  cheating.
* If a student fails two assessments, we will ask them to leave the
  program. This is, in part, because we don't want to push students
  into new material when we feel they would do better to continuing
  working on prior material.
* Each student will be allowed to retake 1 assessment. The retake assessment
  will be a different version but similar material and difficulty. The retake
  will occur the same day after lunch. If a student passes a retake, they will
  continue on in the class. If they fail the retake, we will ask them to leave.
  Once a student has taken a retake assessment, they shall receive no more second
  chances and subsequent failures will result in the student being asked to
  leave the course.

## General advice

More than anything, this is not a typical college course. There are no
final grades, there is no B. We reject 90% of graduates from Ivy
League schools; this class demands a lot.

As the course has gone on, I sense that students see this as a safer
option and a more formulaic process akin to a traditional college
program. That is not true. You don't want to float along in the
class. The course does not teach you everything you need to know.

For nine weeks, you should focus on this course to the exclusion of
pretty much everything else. It is not a joke that you should spend
~90hrs/wk on the course.

In addition to working hard, you need to push beyond your comfort
zone. This class is hard; you need to ask questions. Everyone has a
natural reticence to ask questions, but in this class, it is essential
that you do.

In my experience, the students who fail to complete the course
typically asked far too few questions. If you should feel lost, ask
for help!

You need to focus on understanding concepts **deeply**. We've all had
the experience where we **sort of** understand something. You need to
understand concepts in this class better than that. Concepts build one
on top of the other; if you don't have a rock-solid foundation, you're
going to run into serious trouble.

Lastly: be a smart student. It's hard to estimate how long a project
or reading might take. Start things early. If you think you might have
extra time on a weekend for other things, make sure by doing your
schoolwork first. This is a fast-paced course, you can't afford
unforced errors like running out of time because you started work
late...
