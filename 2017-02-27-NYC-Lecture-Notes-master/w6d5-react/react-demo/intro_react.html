      # What is React?
        - 'A JavaScript library for building user interfaces' - according to their website
        - Simplifies and speeds up the way that we manipulate the DOM
        - Provides a reactive interface that updates when the data it represents changes
          - This data is collectively referred to as the state of the application
        - Best used with JSX, which is syntactic sugar that compiles into calls to React.createElement() and closely resembles regular HTML

      # React vs jQuery
        - Event Handlers
          - In jQuery, event handlers manipulate the DOM
          - In React, event handlers manipulate the state, and \#render() reflects the current state
        - Real vs Virtual DOM
          - jQuery directly traverses and manipulates the DOM, which can be slow
          - React works on a virtual DOM - a stripped-down representation of the actual DOM - and uses a diffing algorithm to smartly re-render only the components that have changed

      ---
      # React Usage - A Summary
        - \#render() is triggered whenever component state or props change
        - Props are passed from parents to children
        - State is changed by calling #setState. Do NOT modify component state by reassigning it.
          ```js
            componentWillReceiveProps(newProps) {
                this.setState({ a: newProps[a] }); //=> totally fine
            }
            componentWillReceiveProps(newProps) {
                this.state = { a: newProps[a] }; //=> NOT GOOD VERY BAD
            }
          ```
        - Component lifecycle methods allow us to perform a variety of other functions that may trigger state or props changes
