RAILS
- a framework
- ORM
- allows users to interact with app

To make a new project use:
`rails _4.2.6_ new `project_name` --database=postgresql`

important folders and files for us now:
- app
- db
- Gemfile

Migrations:
- this is how we form our database
- change structure of database (add/remove tables, columns, etc.)
- Do not insert data
- don't rollback, just make a new migration
- if you've already run the migration, do not edit/delete the file!

Associations:
- foreign key references primary key in other table
- foreign key represents 'belongs to' association
