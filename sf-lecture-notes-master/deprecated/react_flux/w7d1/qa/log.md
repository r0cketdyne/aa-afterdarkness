### Questions

  * How do you render a child component? (i.e. use <CompName /> in parent)
  * How to pass props
  * What to include in state
  * Mapping over an array to return JSX, then interpolating in the render method
  * Generally they were very quiet with few questions

### Notes

  * General demo notes:
    * Start by showing them solution the solution in the browser so they know what we're building
    * Skeleton has config all set up - quickly walk students through what I did
    * Show them "Hello World!" rendering on the screen
    * Start with `widget` component.  Render everything that is static.
    * Make API request and start rendering dynamic information
    * Build currency component
    * Add red-green coloring with CSS.  Important to stress that we can dynamically set the `className` of a component.      
  * I jumped right into the demo after covering questions from yesterday and the learning priorities
  * I think the demo was very helpful for them - helped to elicit lots of questions
  * I prodded them with questions for what to do next - made the app development collaborative
  * Sent out the demo afterwards
