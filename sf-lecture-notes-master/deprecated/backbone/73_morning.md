1.  Favorites: people didn't know how to treat them (individual model or
part of collection?) and ran into trouble triggering events when they
weren't on the server.  Some people didn't realize that the save method
takes the callbacks as part of the second argument object.  3.  Students
made a new gist model when they should have used collection.create.
