* First: Any specific questions about Rails Lite?

=====Test Driven Development=====

 * What is Test Driven Development? (TDD)
  - Write a test FIRST
  - Watch it fail (Red)
  - Write code to make it pass (Green)
  - Refactor the code (Refactor)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 * Why do TDD?
  - Catch bugs earlier, saves time later
  - Maintainable code from the start
  - Good code organization; if it's hard to test, might need refactoring




















(Reminder to use Rails 4!)  
 * Setting up RSpec (without integration testing)
  - switch to postgresql while you are at it
  - add the appropriate gems:
      gem 'rspec-rails'
      gem 'factory_girl_rails'
      gem 'faker'
      gem 'shoulda-matchers'
      gem 'guard-rspec'
      
  - rake db:create:all and rake db:test:prepare
  - rails g rspec:install
  - add configs to autogenerate spec files:
  # my_app/config/application.rb

  config.generators do |g|
    g.test_framework :rspec, 
      :fixtures => true, 
      :view_specs => false, 
      :helper_specs => false, 
      :routing_specs => false, 
      :controller_specs => true, 
      :request_specs => true
      # the below line is important!
      # it must go inside the block.
     g.fixture_replacement :factory_girl, :dir => "spec/factories"
  end
  
  
 ->Test this out!  Make a model and see the spec files appear, then run rspec.
    
    
  * Testing a model 
   - validations (w/o factory)
   - the test database is separate from development database
   - making a factory
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Whoa!  What is a factory?
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  * Why factories > fixtures
   - fixtures are basically yaml versions of test data
   - not easy to update
   - can't dynamically generate easily
   
   Do use factories today. :)
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  * More model testing (match and match-participation)
   - important class or instance methods
   - associations (shoulda matchers)
   - note you can also test associations with factories
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    
  * Demo of guard-rspec (runs your tests continuously for you)
   - guard init rspec
   - guard
