# JBuilder

Maka sure they know:

+ JBuilder functions end with a `!`, anything else is a key
+ They can write normal ruby inside of jbuilder, only things prefaced with `json.{name}` are printed to json
+ JBuilder is setting up our data to be easily received by our reducers. Do all the structuring here, not messing around with organization in reducer
+ JBuilder can easily send info from multiple models by nesting each relevant section under a key, for instance `pokemon` and `items`
