# Flex Time Notes

Open Forum is traditionally broken up into two subsections: the lecturer goes over the previous day's homework in the lecture area, while ~4 other TAs stand stationed by whiteboards outside the lecture area covering topics for Flex Time. Students are free to move between stations as they wish, asking questions and watching demonstrations. 

Generally, a poll is sent out over Slack the day before during Floor Time Review, during which TAs are free to sign up for the topics they wish to cover. For TAs that are responsible for flex time (generally a team of 4 or more), it is expected that they will cover important topics that students historically report struggling with.

Junior TAs are excellent candidates for the flex time team, as it encourages them to review important concepts from the course while also allowing them to test the waters for potential future lecturing.

**For all other TAs, Flex Time is currently strictly opt-in.** Though many topics may be noteworthy, the only essential topic is homework coverage by the lecturer. The rest of the topics provide review for students who did not click with the material the first time around, but if not all topics are covered, it is not the end of the world. TAs who have other duties should not feel obliged to participate in Flex Time if they do not want to.

If any student finds themselves egregiously behind on any particular topic, they are still free to consult with their circle leader or another TA directly.

Flex Time topics for each week are listed below. Topics are generally listed in order of perceived importance/popularity. (Topics considered important are marked with a bang symbol`(!)` )
