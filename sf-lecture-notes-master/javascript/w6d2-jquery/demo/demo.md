# Demos

1. Juxtaposed `animate.css` + Daniel Eden's personal website to illustrate the differences between jQuery vs low-level DOM manipulation

2. Demo'ed jQuery methods on jQuery.com

3. Took non-jquery.html and replaced all low-level DOM manipulation with the appropriate jQuery methods

4. Took test.html and commented the scripts in and out to demonstrate jQuery methods.

5. Also showed slink.chat as a full-stack that uses "draggable" from jQuery UI.
