## Wacky Painter Project!

This project has a series of small jQuery challenges to be completed
in the `js/view.js` file.

Use webpack to bundle the js. The webpack config file
has already been set up for you, so you should be able to just run
`webpack --watch`.

After starting webpack, open `index.html` in your browser.

There are several buttons above a grid. These correspond to the
`View.prototype.exerciseX` methods defined in `view.js`.

When you click a button, the instructions for that challenge should pop up
before you!

Complete the challenges in order. The solutions for the exercises are at
the bottom of `view.js`. Do NOT look at a solution until you have completed
the exercise or are irrecoverably stuck.

Have fun!
