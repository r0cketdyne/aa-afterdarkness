## Today's Learning Goals

  * Ruby -> JavaScript
  * Function Invocation
  * Arguments
  * Class Syntax
  * Module Pattern
  * Callbacks
  * Event Loop

---

## [Ruby & JavaScript comparison chart](https://appacademy.github.io/curriculum/language_comparison/index.html)

## Ways to call a function

* Function Style: `fun(arg1, arg2)`
* Method Style: `obj.method(arg1, arg2)`
* Constructor Style: `new`
* `apply(thisArg, [argsArray])`
* `call(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])`

**call demo**

Note: call demo
emphasize not to use arrow functions for instance methods!

(also, they saw the top three ways to call a function yesterday)

---

## Arguments

* Functions happily accept more or fewer arguments than expected
  * array-like `arguments` variable
  * `rest` operator

---

## Class Syntax

* JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance
  * ES6 Classes are syntactic sugar

**proto & class demos**

Note: class demo and proto demo

---

## Module Pattern

* allows us to split our code into multiple files
  * like ruby's `require` and `require_relative`
* Two steps: exporting & importing

**sports demo**

Note: sports demo

don't forget to export!

---

## Callbacks

* Functions that are passed to other functions as arguments

---

## Event Loop

* Asynchronous functions schedule work to be done in the background
  * i.e. timers, AJAX requests, events
* Callbacks are invoked when action needs to occur & stack is empty
* [Event Loop Visualization](http://latentflip.com/loupe)

**read demo**

Note: draw event loop diagram on board
