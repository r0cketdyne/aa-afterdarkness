# Preparing for JS Day 1 lecture

## Topics Covered in Readings/Materials
Given the size of the A04 exam, many students may come into lecture underprepared. Before coming into lecture, well-prepared students will have been exposed to the following topics:
* Basic syntax
* Data types
* Variable declaration in JS
* Functions
* Closures/Scope
* `this`
* Arrow functions

## Topics Practiced in HomeWork
* Very basic scoping with `let`, `const`, and `var`
* String interpolation
* Basic iteration (fizzBuzz, isPrime, sumOfNPrimes)
* Tiny exercise with callbacks
* Constructors
* Closures (many students do not finish this)

## Topics Covered in Today's Projects
* Basic Enumerables (some will take callbacks)
* Monkey-patching onto the prototype
* Iteration
* Recursion
* Classes and Instance Methods
  * ES5 and ES6

## Preparing to Lecture
You will want a tight grasp on:
* Overall JS syntax
* [Where do semicolons go?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Automatic_semicolon_insertion) also [here](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-rules-of-automatic-semicolon-insertion)
* Primitives vs Objects
* 7 falsey values
* Return values for both standard functions and fat-arrow-functions (when do we explicitly return vs implicitly)
* [What happens when we use the `new` keyword to create an instance of a class?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new)
* [What is scope?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scoping_vs._dynamic_scoping)
* The differences between `const`, `let`, and `var`; specifically, you will want to know the difference between function-scoped variables, globally-scoped variables, and block-scoped variables.
* How do we know what `this` is referencing?
* [What is a closure?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

## Your Notes
You will likely want a set of written notes to help you keep track of where you are in the lecture and what material you have left to cover. It is often very useful to have a written version of any live code demos to refer to in case you encounter a typo, get stuck, or have a break in concentration (this can happen when there are a lot of questions about the material).

A typical outline might look like the following:

## JS Day 1 Outline
* Examples
* Goals
* Overview
* Data types
  * `instanceof` vs `typeof`
* Style/Syntax
* Objects
* Constructor Functions
  * Code demo is in slides (covers instance methods)
* Functions
* Variables
* Scope/Closures
  * [Live Coding Demo](./demos/closures.js) (The chants example is the most effective.)
* Callbacks
  * [Live Coding Demo](./demos/callbacks.js) (Do this in Ruby, first, then JS)
* Debugging
