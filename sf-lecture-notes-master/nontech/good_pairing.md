### INTRO

- paired for a few days, we know what it's like
- app academy is NOT a competition
- after the class is over, nobody will care how far you got on w1d4,
- all that matters is do people want to work with you
- as important as how well you master the material
- not only important for success in the course,
- but success getting a job
- half of app academy is coding skills, other half is working collaboratively on a team
- pairing teaches you how to teach and be taught by someone else
- this talk is about good pairing and how to give effective feedback

### Better pairing

- sometimes pair is great, harmony etc
- tough situations will happen
- pairing is messy
- Sometimes too slow, too fast. Communication breakdown.
- collaboration is a huge part of engineering
- many times you will work on projects with groups of 2-8 people that will span years
- have to learn how to get the most out of these partnerships
- so each person can contribute fully and share the load
- learning how to pair well is an essential skill that App Academy is teaching you
- pair score is the strongest indicator of job search success

- Sometimes you will understand the material better: that is all part of the course.
- Your Job: be a patient teacher
- teaching is SUPER important.
- Effective communication of technical topics is at least half of the interview process.
- View days where you are stronger as training for teaching and communication skills.
- talk through your ideas, explain them fully, then check in: ‘does that make sense’?
- let them answer fully and give them time, do not interrupt
- ask for silent thought: have there been times you could have been a more patient teacher?

- patience is very important and not always easy
- make room for your partner to speak up, they may need a moment to think
- listen to your partner
- give them time to explain their ideas
- observe their body language
- if you ask them a question very important that you give them room to answer, don’t just keep talking
- tell them ‘it’s ok to take a break for a minute to formulate our thoughts'
- don’t dare grab the keyboard!

- if English isn't their first language
- it's ok to ask for clarification
- let them know you are happy to explain yourself again if needed
- have empathy for how much more difficult it is to learn this material in a foreign language

- if you are driving and navigator seems stuck: ask ‘what do you think about this’?
- give them ideas but ultimately let them make the decisions

- when your pair is more experienced:
- it’s ok, don’t feel bad
- it’s ok to slow down
- don’t feel discouraged, you belong here, we chose you out of thousands we rejected
- everyone learns differently and some of our lessons won’t click with you

- be honest. DON’T FAKE IT.
- if you are embarrassed to ask a question you HAVE to ask it,
- you can feel that it’s important
- speak up: i don’t get it, still don’t get it, I know this is frustrating but I really want to understand
- ask for silent thought: was there a time you silently didn’t know what was going on?

- If you silently sit in confusion you miss out on learning.
- You must fight for your education at times by being courageous and speaking up.
- I want you all to do this: to FIGHT FOR IT
- after this talk: admit to your partner what you didn’t understand

- some people think out loud
- others need a few seconds of quiet time to think before proceeding
- it’s ok to ask for this time
- you can pause the timer, take some time to think and discuss back and forth talking about your ideas
- as your partner to diagram and draw out their ideas

- if you feeling like you aren’t able to contribute, ideas aren’t being respected or you are being interrupted
- this isn’t ok
- you must tell your partner
- your feelings are valid, it’s OK to speak up
- you might worry about doing so because it will be awkward at best and they might get mad
- but this confrontation is their greatest opportunity for growth
- so addressing it will not only improve your pairing experience today
- will also improve your partners ability to collaborate with others for their entire career
- if it doesn’t get better, find a TA

### Giving Feedback

- if pair is bad, still must be able to communicate
- if something bothers you tell your partner
- this is ok because I say it’s ok
- “Hey, Taylor Swift, I feel like we’re moving too fast and I’m having trouble understanding the material. Would you be okay if we slowed down and refactored this part so I can understand it?”
- always start by saying: “i feel”, no one can dispute that
- everyone is going to let you take the time you need to learn because I said so right now
- disagreements will happen, differences in how you want to proceed, this is normal and will usually resolve itself
- sometimes not: normally the goal is to advocate your side.
- That’s normal and good: we want you to get good at making strong reasoned engineering arguments about how or why to do something.
- sometimes that will still leave you deadlocked
- ask: what do we do?
- I want you to concede. Lay down your arms and join the other side. Being able to compromise and work other peoples’ ideas is much more important than being right.
- not only concede: do the shit out of it, 100% of your abilities
- you might quickly come to an answer that works, but by hearing how another brain solved the problem you gain more tactics and strategies for solving problems farther down the line

### Receiving Feedback and Self Reflection

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18y6vteoaQY&feature=youtu.be&t=110
- if someone tells you that you are being an asshole, you have to accept their critique,
- it is NOT UP TO YOU, it’s up to everyone else
- you have to take them seriously
- If your partner does give you feedback,
- to prevent yourself from being defensive, must recognize their perspective is valid
- natural instinct is to blame them, or rationalize (they are being too sensitive, they should have practiced more)
- stop, they perceived it, your behavior is the cause: believe them and adapt
- if you feel yourself being defensive, pull back, separate, take a break, and think about it rationally
- go to the bathroom, get some water
- then learn from what you have been told and use it to improve
- used to struggling to learn challenging material but this kind of learning and growth is unfamiliar

- at end of every day with an open mind, reflect on how pairing went
- what was your partner’s body language? what did I do to make them feel that way?
- how was I as a pair? what can I learn from the experience to improve?
- sometimes things will be painful and you will feel embarrassed, regretful, guilty
- rather than punish yourself for mistakes, focus on improvement
- use the ‘how good of a pair’ was I to reflect on your pairing, put thought into that
- and whether it was good or bad, come in fresh the next day optimistic to use the lessons learned
- don’t beat yourself up, just learn and come inroads to do better

Audience Participation

- what makes a good pair
