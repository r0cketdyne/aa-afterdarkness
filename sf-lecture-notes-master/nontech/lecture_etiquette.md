## Lecture Etiquette

Note:
Before we start lecture, I'd like to take a second to say that both myself and the teaching staff
have noticed that the actions of some of you during lectures is not consistent with what we expect
here at app academy.

Some of these actions include things like shouting out questions, shouting out answers especially
above the lecturer, having side conversations, or leaving the lecture.

I think it's important to realize the effects that those actions have on others, both your fellow
audience members and also the lecturer.

It is important to have a good etiquette when others are presenting, not only here at app academy
but also in your future job and future events that you will attend as a developer.

Those actions detract from the learning environment of your fellow students. 

It also takes a lot of work, preparation, and bravery for anyone to present in front of a large
group, whether here or elsewhere, so I ask you please to give due respect to both your classmates
and the lecturer.
