## Remember:
* We train tons of people to do this. Pretty much everybody succeeds.
* You are at the very beginning of this process.
* Already, you've done lots of things that other people can't do. You're in a rarefied group!

# Emotional skills

## How to pace yourself through the course
* Have a strong bias toward sleeping.
* Take a day every now and then to slack off a little. You're drinking from a firehose--everyone is--so give yourself a chance to breathe when you need it.
* Make an exercise plan. Exercise is as close as you can get to free medicine.
* Take walks. Fresh air is good for the soul.
