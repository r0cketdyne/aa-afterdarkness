### Imposter Syndrome

+ I have it, do you?

---

### What's Normal (Really)

+ feeling behind
+ not finishing projects
+ failing an assessment
+ graduating and getting an awesome job

---

### But Everyone is So Much Better Than Me!

+ sometimes others will finish before you
+ how does it make you feel?
+ learning comes from struggling with material
  + don't look at the solutions!
+ remember why you are here: to learn

---

### If You Do Finish Early

+ don't make a big deal about it
+ keep working! Do some bonus work! Make up your own!
+ quietly start working on the assignments for tonight
+ have empathy for those around you

---

### Self Care

+ this is a new kind of stress, you are learning a TON
+ have to find new ways to deal with this new stress
+ this class requires the best version of yourself

---

### Self Care - Physical

+ SLEEP - facilitates learning! Allows brain to grow and recover.
+ take breaks - take the lunch!
+ give your brain a chance to rest and approach problems with new mindset
+ eat - healthy food, necessary for clarity, focus, and energy
+ exercise - grow new neurons, exercise promotes this!
  + relieves physical stress, elevates mood, promotes sleep
  + you cannot afford NOT to
+ stay clean: treat your body like the high performance machine it is

---

### Self Care - Mental

+ establish a routine and stick with it
  + visit your favorite coffee shop every day
  + give yourself scheduled breaks to do a little something for yourself
  + is it cooking? basketball? crossword puzzling? acro-yoga?
  + at least once per week, do something fun just for yourself, NO WORK
  
---

### Self Care - Social

+ socialize - build an emotional support network: you need it!
  + make the time to get to know others in the course
  + this network will be priceless professionally and socially
+ help others - good for the soul!
  + answer questions on slack
  + form a study group
  + be someone else's emotional support - share vulnerability  
  + donate to a charity, 'like' something on facebook, anything!

---

### Self Care - Emotional

+ forgive yourself - today is over
  + end of the day: forgive yourself, you accomplished a lot
  + nothing will ever be perfect, you tried with integrity
  + acknowledge what you have done, you are amazing!
+ I am proud of you all, each and every day!

---

### Assessment Prep
+ spaced repetition: spread it out over days, don't cram (exclusively)
+ recreate the environment
  + practice assessment
  + set a timer
  + sit in your pod

---

### Assessments - Day of Prep

+ get plenty of sleep
  + brain flushes out metabolic toxins (really)
+ eat a healthy breakfast
+ dress up (works for me!)
+ come early and get comfortable
+ deep breaths: deep belly inhale, 8 second exhale

---

### Assessments - Tactics

+ do the easy stuff first
+ if you start to panic, catch yourself: take 3 deep slow breaths
+ if you can move on, do so and circle back
+ there IS enough time, rushing is NOT necessary (tortoise vs hare)

---

### Assessments - If You Hit Unconquerable Bug

+ read error messages FULLY
+ follow stack trace, visit each method, where does something go wrong?
+ refactor: rename variables, make it beautiful, the bug will show itself
+ lost item? clean room!

---

### You Can Do IT

+ revision: you ARE doing it!
+ you are a software developer - say it right now!
+ SO many professionals cannot solve problems as hard as your technical interview
