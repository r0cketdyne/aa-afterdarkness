emphasize the overall idea that we should be caring individuals

## structure
+ specifics of what has been going wrong
+ zero tolerance - has been applied
+ how to speak up
+ micro-aggressions
+ what it means that it's difficult to be a women
+ how to speak up
+ job-search area for work, tell a staff member if area not productive
+ conclusion - culture of respect, individual responsibility


## notes
+ wake up call
+ think its a joke but it will make people feel uncomfortable and unsafe
+ drive home point that people may not speak up even if they feel uncomfortable
+ they might be dismissed for being too sensitive
+ it's difficult to just say this is NOT OK
+ people face a multitude of tiny offenses and pile up
+ different backgrounds, might not know what is appropriate in this environment
+ a lot of what happens are micro-aggressions, but they nudge people away from the field
+ individual offense seems so small in isolation, but it accumulates
+ and the result is that the harassed group is inclined to leave the field where
+ they aren't a super minority
+ 'shouldn't you have a job you are a girl' - dismisses that they went through the same
struggles, not worthy due to intelligence and skill, dismisses their efforts,
it takes a lot for women to get into this field
+ 1. not true, 2. if you do get a job you wonder if it's because a girl, 3. if you don't
it suggests that you are especially bad
+ w - it's really hard to speak up, fear of being called to sensitive
+ even if you don't like the dominant culture there is a sense you need to belong
  to it to succeed
+ we need to help each other which is why it's unacceptable
  to be exclusive with behavior
+ this is a safe space and right now it's not and that needs to change
+ scott - this is what is going to happen in a workplace, get ready for it now
+ laura - culture of respect, no amount of rules will stop people from telling jokes,
we need the culture to be one of respect
+ this is about gender, might have some examples about race or other margnalized groups
but we received a complaint about gender issues so this talk is about that
+ not treating like a problem is part of the problem


## Zero Tolerance
+ reported behavior will NOT be tolerated
+ depending on severity response might be a discussion or dismissal from course
+ we HAVE dismissed people that have received warnings and not changed behavior

## You are a woman, you will get a job easily
+ meant to be positive, 'the job search will be easy! :)'
+ this is NOT helpful
+ if you work with a male colleague with the same credentials/experience,
a woman could feel that he was hired for his abilities and that he is better
still have doubt he was hired purely for skill, woman would doubt herself for a long time
people around you are more qualified and you are there not because of your skills
+ dismisses how difficult the struggle still is
+ was it skill or qualification, or just a woman for the website?
+ if it does take a while, does that mean it is especially bad
+ other people in tech say this, family members say this
+ undeserving of the job you do get

## Race - seems like we are favoring asians here, race should probably be another lecture
+ asians in CS - sets expectations that are generalized
+ takes away individual success
+ if you don't do well then it feels extra bad
+ even as a joke, it perpetuates the stereotype

##
+ minorities have been discriminated against forever
+ identical resumes - white guy statistically more often chosen
+ effort to restore equality in hiring practices
+ saying this has the effect of making people uncomfortable and that's unacceptable


## Making Your Voice Heard
+ let a staff member you feel comfortable with know
+ we will protect your privacy
+ its normal for the person that feels uncomfortable to be reluctant to come forward with complaints
 because they don't want the offender to be dismissed or punished, but then the victim
 has to bear the burden of continued harassment, which is unfair
 + the victim has to continue to suffer, also others could be affected

+ just because someone doesn't tell you that they are uncomfortable, doesn't mean
that they are comfortable
+ 'just a joke', 'calm down', 'don't be so sensitive'
+ sum of micro-aggressions
+ most times people won't speak up, so it is YOUR responsibility to speak carefully
and consider how your actions can affect others day today or long term when it comes
to how people think about themselves and their careers

+ tech has reputation of being 'bro-ey' environment, that doesn't mean as an
individual in this field you should perpetuate it
+ you have the power to move tech in a new direction




## Examples of things not to do
+ Talking about pornography/masturbation
+ Using vulgar variable names
+ Making comments about other students
+ Discussing physical appearance - rating other's appearance
+ Eyeing physical appearance
+ Making suggestive comments or gestures
+ Looking at vulgar websites
+ Suggestions that some students may be treated differently due to gender, race, or orientation
+ Speculation about orientation or trans status
+ personal questions about bodies or relationships


## The End
+ most important: this is still a professional environment, even if you
are left alone this is a workspace for everyone and the same rules apply
+ no one's individual merit's should be ignored or generalized into stereotypes

## story
+ girl corner
+ excited to not have to come in to the unwelcome environment
+ frat floor, with girl corner
+ office should feel professional even if we are working on their own
+ doesn't want to get singled out as a victim

## Other Notes
+ school code of conduct a bit looser
+ we adopt a workplace code of conduct
  + we want you to be aware of how the workplace environment works
  + more importantly: this industry has an epidemic of these sorts of micro-aggressions
  + we want to produce citizens that can improve the culture
  + need to be vigilant so we can improve the culture
