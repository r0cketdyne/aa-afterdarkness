### I. Imposter Syndrome: You Are Doing OK!

for many, this is the most rigorous educational challenge they have faced

Many feel behind
Like they are struggling to keep up
don’t finish projects
that’s ok, that’s normal
thats how MOST students feel
and MOST students complete the course and get great jobs

some days people around you might finish early
this can really make you feel like they get it and you don't
you still get plenty from days you don’t complete projects
struggling with the material makes it more memorable
(which means, don’t go looking at the solutions!)

if you do finish early, know how frustrating it can be for those around you to see you slacking off, just keep working, do bonuses, quietly start working on the material for tonight

have empathy for people around you

### II. Assessments:
do the practice assessments
come early and get comfortable in the environment
take deep breaths, hold and release slowly for a few minutes before 9
if you feel yourself starting to panic because you are stuck, take a step back, take 3 slow deep breaths, go to a different part and work on another spec, if you can’t figure it out, refactor, rename things, make it pretty
people run out of time when they get stuck, it is rare that there is just too much code to write in the allotted time
realize that rushing will not help you finish faster
read the error messages, slowly and carefully
read the stack trace and think through where every line of code goes
where does something go awry?

### III. Self Care: Dealing with This New Stress
this is a point of growth! you are learning a lot
also means you are under a new kind of stress
and you have to find new ways to address this new stress

here’s what you should do to handle this new stress:

- sleep, reinforces learning, not as productive if under rested. It’s a proven fact you can’t learn as much or retain information if you aren’t rested. An extra hour of study doesn’t help as much as an extra hour of sleep.
- take breaks, take the lunch. Spend time away from the screen resting and refreshing your mind. You will be able to focus better. Approach problems that made you stuck with a new mindset. Many times you just need to be away from a problem for a little while to immediately solve it.
- eat. Healthy food. This will give you the energy and focus you need to keep working through the entire day. You have a lot of work to do and it requires the best version of yourself. You can’t perform to your peak unless you are well fueled. Brain needs a lot of energy to function. Make healthy choices for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner.
- physical self care, go for a walk, run, do some yoga, stretch, ride a bicycle, then take a shower and put on some nice clean clothes. This will do wonders for your well being and give you clarity. It’s hard to choose this over cramming an additional half hour of studying, but it is worth it. You will be able of focusing more deeply and learning and accomplishing more. The study you do have after that will be higher quality and more effective.
- forgive yourself, always push yourself and try to be better the next day, but at the end of each day forgive yourself and understand how much you have accomplished. Many days have too much material to complete. Acknowledge what you learned and be proud of what you have achieved. Don’t beat yourself up about not finishing a project or not achieving what you had hoped to.
- establish a routine and stick to it. Find out what makes you happy and stick to it. Make sure there are breaks just for you as part of your morning and evening routine. Cook yourself a healthy meal. Maybe visit your favorite coffee shop every day and give coding a rest while you are there. Make a time of each week that you don’t do any work at all.
- socialize, you need emotional support to make it through the course. Make time to see people that you care about and care about you. Fellow students can be a great network and many meaningful friendships can come from this. Most important to make time for people that you care about be it from App Academy or not.
- help others! Engage on slack channel, help people study. Be a supportive friend and know that people around you are suffering from the same self doubt and stress you are and you can be a person that makes them feel much better.

### IV. You can do it.
You ARE a software developer already!
tell yourself this now

fizz buzz, bubble sort MANY pro’s can’t do this stuff
you are going to be able to go into the industry and get a good job

this is hard, it is supposed to be, and you are doing it

you are smart enough

I believe in you!
