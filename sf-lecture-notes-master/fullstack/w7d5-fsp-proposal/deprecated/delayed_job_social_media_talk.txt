=====Three Topics=====

 * Delayed Job
 * Heroku Scheduler and Rake Tasks
 * Social Media SDKs
 
 =====Delayed Job=====

  * Standard way to deal with sending emails, or doing any heavy I/O operations
  * Also a way to schedule tasks for future
  * You want the one by collectiveidea
  * Set it up in three steps!
    - gem 'delayed_job_active_record'
    - rails generate delayed_job:active_record
    rake db:migrate
    - @user.delay.do_long_task
    !!!
    rake jobs:work
    !!!
    
          UserMailer.delay.welcome_email(@user)
          
          reminder_email.send_at(2.minutes.from_now, :deliver!)

          handle_asynchronously :time_consuming_task    
    
  * Other things you can do:
  handle_asynchronously to have that job always handled asynchronously
  handle_asynchronously :in_the_future, :run_at => Proc.new { 5.minutes.from_now }
  handle_asynchronously :call_an_instance_method, :priority => Proc.new {|i| i.how_important }
  @user.send_later(:deliver)
  You can also write a class with a "perform" method, and then you can pass this into a queue as a job.
  Named Queues:
  object.delay(:queue => 'tracking').method
  Delayed::Job.enqueue job, :queue => 'tracking'
  handle_asynchronously :tweet_later, :queue => 'tweets'
  
=====Heroku Scheduler=====

 * Talk about it
  - Running delayed job on Heroku takes dyno hours
  - You can save hours (and $) by only running the tasks at certain intervals.
  Heroku scheduler can be used for this.
  - Heroku scheduler is an add-on for Heroku.  Add-ons are plugins, often by a 3rd party.
  - It's free, but also unreliable.  Clock processes are another option;
  more detail than that is beyond the scope of this discussion, but you should know 
  what these options are in case you need them.

 
=====Social Media SDKs=====

 * For you right now, Social Media SDKs are the icing on the cake: recruiters and employers likely won't give you Facebook permissions etc., or use your "tweet this" button.
 That said, using many API/SDKs looks good to employers, just maybe don't focus on it.
 Still a cool thing to know about.
 * Tools to integrate social media features in your app
 * Share, Like, Tweet buttons (have the windows open to copy paste)
 * Facebook Graph API
 * Facebook Query Language
 * There is much more; this is like a free sample!
