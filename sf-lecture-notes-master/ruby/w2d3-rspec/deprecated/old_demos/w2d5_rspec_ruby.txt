 * First: Any specific questions about checkers solution?
 Not going to do demo of checkers, but could explain the solution.

=====RSPEC BASICS=====

 * Why learn RSpec?
  - Debugging
  - Maintaining
  - Jobs












 * What is RSpec?
 - Just a Ruby library
 - All of the 'magic' methods are still Ruby methods
 - Gems are libraries

















 * TDD: Test Driven Development
  1) Write the test
  2) Watch it fail (Red)
  3) Write code to make it pass (Green)
  4) Go back and refactor the code (Refactor)
  - This is the 'Red, green, refactor' approach
  - Not often used irl, but good for practice
  - AND many places admire TDD












 * What to test?
 - Public methods, 
 because if those work the private ones should work too
 - ALL the public methods (be thorough today)
 - You already know OO programming; focus on RSpec and testing today.
















 * Setting Up and Syntax
 - Demo
 - 'should' vs. 'expect' (old and new syntax)
 - You won't use rake today















 * Read the Docs
 - In general, towards the end of each unit (Ruby, SQL, Rails),
 we will expect you to read the docs and use google.
 - This is good; reading documentation is a skill.













 ALSO Please do warm-up project first ("First TDD Projects")
