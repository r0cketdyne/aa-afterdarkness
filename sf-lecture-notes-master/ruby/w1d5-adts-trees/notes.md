NOTES:

YESTERDAY syntactic sugar on board in minesweeper

ASSESSMENT how much to study / how to know what to know for the assessment

HW array duping / mutation assigning in Map class â€” no duplicate keys

TODAY implementation details

Helpful if you can repeat the questions that are asked before answering because the students mumble and are hard to hear
