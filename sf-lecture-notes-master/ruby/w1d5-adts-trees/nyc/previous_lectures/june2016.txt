TREE
  - made up of nodes
  - nodes have one parent, potentially many children, and a value
  - node 1 is the root
  - 4,5,6,7 are the leaves because they have no children
  - binary trees have nodes that have at most 2 children

Depth First Search
  - initially visited order: 1,2,4,5,3,6,7


Breadth First Search
  - initially visited order: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
  - use a queue
  1) start by enqueuing root node
  2) check if first node on queue is target, if it is return the node
  3) if it is not target, shift it off the queue
  4) enqueue that node's children
  5) go back to step 2
