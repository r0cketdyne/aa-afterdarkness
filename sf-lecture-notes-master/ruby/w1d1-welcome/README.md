---

### In Class

+ Morning: lecture or study hall
+ Rest of the day: pair programming
+ Routine
  + Create a folder on the desktop, open it in Atom.
  + Go through projects and exercises in order
  + If you're stuck
    + First: ask your partner
    + Then: ask your cohort on slack
    + Then: google the error in multiple ways
    + Lastly: call an instructor
  + It's not a race; comprehension is all that matters
  + **DO NOT REFER TO THE SOLUTIONS**
  + Don't fork the repos

---

### Evening Work

+ Review solutions
  + Understand every line
  + Take notes, if you'd like
  + Bring questions
+ Watch video lectures
  + Use a browser extension to speed up the video
  + Take notes, if you'd like
+ Do readings and homework
  + SUPER important for getting the most out of next day
  + submit via email each night: instructors-sf@appacademy.io 
  + "HWRK W?D? {FirstName LastName}"
+ Read project for the next day but do NOT work on it

---

### Progress Tracker

+ Fill out progress tracker report every night
  + ALWAYS due at 9am, weekend reports due Monday
  + Staff feedback very important to us, take it seriously
  + Be honest in pair reviews, we wont share with your partner
  + We will provide general anonymized feedback for you upon request
+ FYI: your progress report will be thoroughly read by your circle leader
+ Do the daily quiz (tonight you will do quiz for W1D2)
+ Finally, if you have extra time, try to finish up the day's projects

---

### Assessments

+ About once a week, 1 - 2 hours in length
+ Use a school machine unless you are 100% confident in your system ruby
  + rbenv - ruby 2.5.0
  + Know how to install gems
+ Randomly generated
+ Cheating == immediate expulsion
+ Do not share the assessment with anyone, especially future students
+ Do not push any assessments to Github
+ If someone shares an old assessment with you, this is cheating

---

### Assessment Advice

* 1 passed spec == 1 point, target passed specs
* If you get a bug: relax, breath, read the entire error message
* Test your assumptions with the debugger in the terminal
* Look at the spec files
* No partial credit; if you are stuck for a while, move on and circle back
* If you have technical difficulties, ask an instructor for help!

---

### Retakes + the Elephant in the Room

+ Retake if you fail a second assessment
  + *One* retake per person
  + The retake is given on same day
  + It is a different version of the assessment

---

### Strikes

+ Our unique tuition model requires mutual accountability
+ 10 available
+ You will be notified via email if you receive a strike
  + To contest a strike, let your circle leader know
+ Reasons for receiving a strike:
  + Lateness
  + Not submitting a progress report (common)
  + Personal devices visible
    + _Never_ have your cell phone or laptop out during pairing time
+ We will cut you slack TODAY, and today only.

---
### Job Search Strikes
  + Later parts of the course use different strike policies.
  + Once you start your full-stack project, any strikes over 10 become Job Search Strikes
---


### Illness

+ 3 sick days
+ Notify us before class starts
+ Send in your work at the end of the day to your circle leader
+ If you submit an adequate amount of work, your strikes will be absolved
+ Missing class is not ideal; making other people miss class is unacceptable

---

### Pairing

+ Why? - best way to learn, produces highest quality code, stay focused
+ Navigator: makes the plan
+ Driver: executes the plan
+ Switch every 15 min - there is a timer on the new tab page.
+ How much control? - whatever is needed, driving through SF
+ Use Atom
+ Every error/bug is a learning opportunity; don't waste it!

---

### Pairing: "Do"s

+ Remember that everyone belongs here; don't judge
+ Come prepared
+ The goal is to learn, not to race through the projects
+ Maintain good personal hygiene
+ Switch every 15 minutes, even if you are in the middle of something

---

### Pairing: "Don't"s

+ Touch the keyboard/mouse if you are the navigator
+ Ignore the navigator if you are the driver
+ Become passive as the navigator
+ Give up.
  + Coding can be hard. Keep working through it!

---

### What did I sign up for?

+ This is a bootcamp.
+ This is rigorous training.
+ The end of App Academy is only the beginning.
+ Not a competition; all that matters is how ready you are for the job search
+ There is no magic, no shortcut. You are going to put in a TON of hard work
+ Your fellow students are your teammates, not the enemy
+ The good news: it's actually really fun and you are going to love it!
