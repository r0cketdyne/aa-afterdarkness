## Suggestions
  * Focus on the front-end auth pattern! Don't get too bogged down in normal react / redux stuff they should already know.
  * Draw the request / response cycle for "old school auth" and show how it changes for "front end auth"
  * Emphasize that "front end auth" is no different from week 4 auth, as far a rails is concerned -- same models, controllers, etc. Only difference is that now we have /api routes and jbuilder views
  * expect questions on AuthRoute and ProtectedRoute -- walk through these
  methods repeatedly
