## Front End Auth

* SAME AUTH PATTERN you know and love
* Using JSON API instead
* Bootstrapping current user
* Use this pattern in your full stack projects!

Note:
Emphasize that "front end auth" is no different from week 4 auth, as far a rails is concerned -- same models, controllers, etc. Only difference is that now we have /api routes and jbuilder views
- Draw rails auth diagram on the board, then add front end auth on top
