## Meditation

---

## NPM and webpack demo

+ NPM is a package manager and software registry
+ Similar to `gem` in ruby, except the packages are saved local to the project
+ `package.json` === `Gemfile`
+ Yarn is an alternative that stores packages in one location
  + Google and FB have recently switched to yarn, but NPM is way more popular

---

## React

+ Frontend library for creating UI components
  + It is the V in the frontend MVC
+ Created by Facebook in 2013
+ Pairs a virtual DOM with the actual DOM to determine what should be changed

---

## React Component

+ Returns virtual representation of HTML Elements (& child elements)
+ Single Responsibility Principle
+ Pure function

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) { // this implementation is implicit!
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello!<h1>
    );
  }
}
```

Note:
[Pure functions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)
  + Has a deterministic output based on the input
  + Produces no side effects

This is the default `constructor` method, do not need to always write it.
This is just to show what it is. Only need to overwrite for binding methods or
creation of local state.

Defining a `render()` method is required.

---

### Using a React Component

```html

<MyComponent /> // instantiation

```

---

### Local State
+ Explicitly created in the constructor
+ Referenced by `this.state`
+ Do not modify `this.state` directly!

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {};
  }
  // ...
}
```

Note:
`setState` runs asynchronously, so make sure to run anything depending on it in
a callback!

---

## `this.setState`

+ Runs _asynchronously_
+ Function signature
  + the object that will be the new state
  + The callback that is called after the new state is set

```js
this.setState(newState, callback)

// merge new state with current state
this.setState(Object.assign(this.state, newState), callback);
```

---

## Props

+ Passed to the component when it is instantiated
+ Referenced by `this.props`
+ **Do not** store parts of `props` in `this.state`
  + They should not contain the same information
+ For now, a component can't directly change its props
  + We will be able to do this on Monday with Redux

```js
<MyComponent name="Aaron" />

// Somewhere in the component
this.props.name; // => "Aaron"
```

Note:
Don't store props in state because props will already trigger lifecycle methods
Will be explained in the next slide

The inputs into the React pure function are `props` and `state`. Any changes to
how the component looks should be performed by changes to `state` or `props`.

---

## Lifecycle Methods

+ Mounting
+ Updating
+ Unmounting

Note:
In an ideal world, we wouldnâ€™t use lifecycle methods. All our rendering issues
would be controlled via state and props.

Use these methods sparingly when you need more control over how your component
updates.

---

## Mounting

+ `constructor()`
+ `componentWillMount()`
  + Not very useful
+ `render()`
+ `componentDidMount()`
  + Here is where we will call our AJAX requests!

Note:
We do not want to cal AJAX requests in componentWillMount because we can't
guarantee that our component will mount before the request resolves. This would
mean `setState` could be called before we even have a component with state!

---

## Updating

+ **`componentWillReceiveProps()`**
  + Receiving new props starts here
  + Act on changes to particular props and set new state accordingly
+ **`shouldComponentUpdate()`**
  + `setState()` starts here
  + The default is `return true;`
  + Stop renders in certain cases of changed props
+ **`componentWillUpdate()`**
  + Pretty useless for the most part
+ **`render()`**
+ **`componentDidUpdate()`**
  + Also pretty useless

Note:
We might want to stop a re-render if our props change but the props that did
change do not directly influence what is being rendered. Say, some background
data.

---

## Unmounting

+ **`componentWillUnmount()`**
  + Remove event listeners, etc

Note:
These methods are called in this order and we can overwrite them to have certain
actions taken when things happen.

---

## Reconciliation

+ The virtual DOM
+ `render()` vs `render()` for new `state` or `props`

```html
<button class='button button-blue'>
  <b>
    OK!
  </b>
</button>

{
  type: 'button',
  props: {
    className: 'button button-blue',
    children: {
      type: 'b',
      children: 'OK!'
    }
  }
}
```

Note:
The virtual DOM is a javascript representation of the actual DOM.

React will call the render function with new `state` or `props` and compare it
to the current representation in the virtual DOM.

Quick note about the diffing algo (see `lecture_prep.md` for articles on this
+ If the `type` is different (`button`, `div`) it does a full re-render of that
portion of the DOM
+ If the `type` is the same, it does a diff of the keys and only updates the
parts that changed, then recursively diffs the children

---

## Class vs Functional Components

Stateful vs Stateless Components

```js
class Button extends React.Component {
  // remember, implicit constructor
  render() {
    return (
      <button className="{this.props.className">
        {this.props.text}
      </button>
    );
  }
}

const Button = (props) => (
  <button className="{props.className}">
    {props.text}
  </button>
);

```

Note:
We want to prefer functional if possible. They are smaller and faster.

---

## When to use Stateful

1. Want to use lifecycle hooks
2. Want to keep a local state
  + forms
  + ui changes not handled by parent component
