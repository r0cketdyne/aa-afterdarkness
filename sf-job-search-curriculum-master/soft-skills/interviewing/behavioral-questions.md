## Behavioral Questions

Behavioral questions are a type of interview question that ask about specific situations from your past.  For example "Tell me about a time you dealt with an interpersonal issue" is a behavioral question.  The interviewer is trying to get a picture of how you handle yourself at a job.   

Answers to behavioral questions should also take the form of a story.  Remember to include specifics about time/place. The story should begin with a problem, then describe actions you took, and end with a result. Together, this should take about 30 seconds.  
* Problem - the situation that required support or intervention
* Action - what you did to address the problem
* Result - the improved situation produced through your actions

An example for the question "Tell me about a time you took initiative to do improve something."  
* *Problem:* "When I was at ABC company, we kept all our data on spreadsheets.  There were so many, the sheets were almost impossible to keep updated.  And when I tried to find information for a client, it sometimes took me 30 minutes to find the numbers I needed."
* *Action:* "I started researching better ways to store data, and found a number of database options online. I researched three different options, discussed each with my manager, and ultimately chose Salesforce as the best fit for us."
* *Result:* "I worked with our office manager to get the system set up, and two months later, we not only had cleaner data that was easier to update, but were able to keep track of almost twice as many metrics as we were before."  

Answers to these questions can come from your work history, academic projects, or even personal projects.  

Other behavioral questions include:
* What do you consider your greatest career accomplishment?
* Tell me about a time you dealt with an interpersonal issue.
* What was the hardest problem your ran into in the job?
* Tell me about a time you had to teach yourself something in order to reach your goal.  
* Tell me about the most difficult challenge you encountered on that software project.

## You should ask questions too

At the end of almost any interview, the interviewer will ask you what questions you have for them.  This may appear to signal the end of the interview, but this is not the case.  Because this is the only part of the conversation that you control, they will judge you based on the questions you ask and how astute they seem.  

You'll be prompted to read about this again next week, but if you want to skip ahead, some discussion about it is [here][questions-to-ask].
