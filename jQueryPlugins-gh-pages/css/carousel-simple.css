/* RESET */

/*
Carefully reset the tags you are using. Instead of using
the * asterisk wildcard selector, I hand pick my own tags.
Occasionally you'll want to avoid reseting a tag, like on
certain form inputs. This allows you to be intentional.
It also helps me keep track of the elements I'll be
working with.

  Having font, color, and text-align properties set to
  inherit, and thus receive their parents' values, turns out
  to be super useful. You only want to declare the font

  reset, or you'll lose the cascading property, and will be
  fighting it all throughout your stylesheet.
