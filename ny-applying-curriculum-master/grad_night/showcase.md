# Grad Showcase

The final Thursday of our curriculum will be the night of our graduation showcase. You'll have a chance to demonstrate your projects in a "science fair" format for alumni and recruiters. While some students will receive jobs directly from this experience, everyone has the opportunity to benefit from a friendly networking atmosphere filled with people rich in advice and knowledge about the job search. The showcase typically runs from **5pm - 8:30pm**

## Details

* Pizza, snacks, and beer are provided. Please drink responsibly. 
* Make sure you set up one person per desk. You want room for someone to sit next to you!
* Keep track of everyone that speaks to you. Follow-up with a thank you message the day after.
* Bring printed out copies of your resume, business cards, candy, etc. 
  * The showcase is about your personality and brand as much as your projects.
  
## Tips for Success

* Be proactive! Don't wait for someone to approach, go out and introduce yourself to people.
* Have questions ready to keep the conversation going.
  * "Where do you work?"
  * "What technologies do you use?"
  * "What is your company's culture like?"
* Practice how you will talk about your portfolio.
  * What features are you particularly proud of?
  * Why did you choose your JavaScript project?
  * What skills do you think distinguish you?
* Have fun! This is a celebration of all the hard work you've put in the last few months.
