# Trade 'n Upgrade

This project is a chance to practice adding features to someone else's codebase, a skill that is essential in the majority of developer jobs. If chosen as a [Flex Project](./flex-project.md), you will need to develop a substantial feature in someone else's full stack project and exchange your own full stack project for a similar addition. This adds great talking points during interviews, as you'll be able to intelligently communicate about what it's like working on a larger team project.

Possible features will vary greatly depending on the capstone, but should be substantial though not excessive, enough to fill 15-20 hours--don't underestimate how much time it will take to plan, understand another's code, and discuss changes. Aim for low-hanging feature-fruit, something just past MVP.

1. Pick a partner to exchange full stack projects with.
2. Find a time to fully flesh out proposed features for each full stack project.
 * Include new API endpoints, changes to schema, wireframes, React components.
3. Utilize a [github workflow][github-workflow] that allows for multiple contributors.
  * Create and checkout a new feature branch.
  * Regularly rebase or merge master into feature branch if project owner is continuing to update master (at the very least, do this before submitting your pull request).
  * When feature is complete, submit a Pull Request so that project owner can review code.
  * Discuss code, make any necessary changes. When project owner approves the pull request, merge the feature branch into master.
4. Update project README to reflect changes and link to contributor's github. It is unnecessary to outline specifically which features the contributor developed--anyone interested can check the commit history. Contributors should not have a separate README.
5. Project owner should change their title on their resume from "Sole Developer" to "Project Owner", "Lead Developer", or similar. Contributor should add their project to their resume, outlining specifically which feature(s) they implemented. Be clear, and outline any particular achievements, technologies used, etc. Title on resume should be "Contributor" or "Contributing Developer".
