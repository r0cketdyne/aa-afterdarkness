# Build a Ruby Gem or JS Library

Build and publish a Ruby gem or a JavaScript library! Much like [Chrome Extensions][chrome-ext], these should ideally meet a real-world need. However, there is some flexibility! Students have successfully turned their [RailsLite/ActiveRecordLite][code-intensive] projects into gems, assembled collections of algorithms and data structures in [JavaScript](https://github.com/Razynoir/Algorithms) or [Ruby](https://github.com/MrMicrowaveOven/zadt), and created entirely new gems or libraries for their own use.

1. Decide on a gem or library to build. Keep in to a manageable length--the goal is to spend 15-20 hours on this project.
2. Review the appropriate requirements in the guides below before starting to code.
3. Write your code!
4. Submit to an online repository, outlined below.  Where applicable, get a few friends to use the gem and leave positive reviews.  
5. Don't forget to write a README and add it to your resume! Detailed requirements in the [Flex Project][flex-proj] reading.
