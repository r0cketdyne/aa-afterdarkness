### Backbone App Demo - Videos

Watch a perfect Backbone application built from beginning to end.

Be sure to review every commit diff by clicking the ':notebook: diff'
link to the right of the video to observe the actual changes made in the
video.

Note: the app in these videos is built with Rails 3. One notable
difference between Rails 3 and Rails 4 is how params are handled.
[This short reading][rails-3-vs-4] can tell you more.
