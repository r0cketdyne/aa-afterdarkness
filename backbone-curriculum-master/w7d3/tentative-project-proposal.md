# Tentative Project Proposal

Before we ask you to pour your heart and soul into crafting a polished,
thorough blueprint for your capstone project, we want to be doubly sure
that your core idea is strong enough not only to stand on its own, but
to really wow employers. We also want to encourage some variety among
capstone projects; this helps distinguish graduates from each other and
is good for the class as a whole.

To facilitate this, we're going to have you submit to us your top three
choices of project. You'll do this through a Google form we send to your
email. At most one of your choices can be a project of your own design;
in this case, select "Other" and write a brief outline in the provided
text field (details below). Your other choices should be clones of
projects on the [approved list][clone-link].

## Project Outline

This is required if you're proposing a unique project, but it's a good
exercise even if you're planning a straight, no-frills clone. You should
write a bulleted list of the features you will need to implement for
your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Think carefully about this, but don't
spend more than 30 minutes actually writing the outline. The idea is not
to sit down and plan everything out in minute detail. Instead, consider
this a sales pitch. Give us enough detail to show that the project has
merit and that you have a game plan for making it happen.

### Example

#### Project: Trello Clone
* Users can sign up and sign in
* Users can create and view boards
* Users can create lists, and lists are shown on the associated board
* Users can create cards, and cards are shown on the associated list
* Clicking on a card triggers a modal view with details and comments
* Lists and cards are draggable
* Dragging lists and cards causes any changes in order to be saved to
  the database.
* Boards, lists, and cards can be destroyed or marked complete
