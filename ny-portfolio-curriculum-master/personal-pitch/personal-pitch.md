# Personal Pitch

**So, tell me about yourself.** 

**What is your background?**

**Why did you change careers?**

**How did you get interested in development?**

Your personal pitch addresses these fundamental questions which occur early on in every interview situation. A strong first impression sets the tone for the rest of the interview. **Every interviewer expects to hear confident, concise responses to these questions.**

## Brainstorming

Write down responses to these questions and bring them to class for W10D3:

1. What programming/problem solving skills do you possess?
2. What makes you stand out from the rest of your App Academy cohort?
3. When did you become interested in problem solving?
4. What is your favorite part about programming?
5. How does your background relate to programming? (Get creative)
6. Where do you want to grow as a developer? What areas interest you?


## Telling Your Story

Your pitch is *a story*. It should have a beginning, middle, and end.

Start by introducing yourself as a web developer with a strong skill set (Rails, React, JavaScript, CSS, SQL, etc.).
Then briefly touch on your background and how it reinforces those skills. Then talk about what you're
working on now and conclude with your goals for the future. Make sure to keep your focus on programming!

## Outline

Read over the following template and then write down your own outline. Sentence fragments
and keywords are all that's needed. You want to sound natural, not like you're just
regurgitating a script.

### Intro

"I'm a web developer with experience building apps using Rails, React, and JavaScript."

**N.B. Mention the technologies you know that are relevant for the position!**

### Beginning

"In college I chose to major in [...] and took a lot of classes in [...] because I like working
on problems that involve [...]. At [company] I accomplished [...] and [...]. While I was at it
I learned [...]."

**N.B. Focus on positive experiences that moved you towards programming**

### Middle

"I wanted to level up my skills I've been building projects every day using
Rails, React, and JavaScript. I recently built {Describe your project}. One of the coolest parts
is {describe a feature that stands out}. I've also found that my background in [...] has made me
a much better programmer because of [...]"

**N.B. Don't feel like you need to bring up App Academy. Your skills stand on their own!**

### End

"What I'm looking for now is an opportunity to continue to develop my skill set at a company with interesting technical challenges and a product I can believe in."

**N.B. Connect your background and skills to this company and position**

Notice that each part of the story includes specific details such as time/place, projects, and
accomplishments. Specifics are critical for your listener to fully understand your story.

## Behavioral Questions

Behavioral questions are a type of interview question that ask about specific situations from your past.
For example "Tell me about a time you dealt with an interpersonal issue" is a behavioral question. The interviewer is trying to get a picture of how you handle yourself at a job.   

Answers to behavioral questions should also take the form of a story.  Remember to include specifics
about time/place. The story should begin with a problem, then describe actions you took, and end with
a result. Together, this should take about 45 seconds.  

* __Problem:__ The situation that required support or intervention.
* __Action:__ What you did to address the problem.
* __Result:__ The improved situation produced through your actions.

### Example

__Question:__ "Tell me about a time you took initiative to do improve something."

* __Problem:__ "When I was at ABC company, we kept all our data on spreadsheets. There
were so many, the sheets were almost impossible to keep updated. And when I tried to
find information for a client, it sometimes took me 30 minutes to find the numbers I needed."

* __Action:__ "I started researching better ways to store data, and found a number of database
options online. I researched three different options, discussed each with my manager, and ultimately
chose Salesforce as the best fit for us."

* __Result:__ "I worked with our office manager to get the system set up, and two months later,
we not only had cleaner data that was easier to update, but were able to keep track of almost
twice as many metrics as we were before."  

Answers to these questions can come from your work history, academic projects, or even personal projects.  

### More common questions

A well rehearsed response to these will help you stand out.  

* How did you hear about us?
* Why do you want to work at our company?
* Why do you want to be a programmer?
* Where do you see yourself five years down the road?
* How did you teach yourself to program?
    * Here it makes sense to bring up App Academy.
* How do you go about picking up a new technology?
* What kinds of problems do you like to work on?
* What was the hardest coding project you ever did?
* What work have you done that you are most proud of?
* What's your biggest weakness?

### Coding-specific questions

* What do you like about Ruby?
    * Talking points: readable, object-oriented, designed for developer happiness
* What do you like about Rails?
    * Talking points: "convention over configuration", community
* Walk me through your development process for a new project.
    * Pro moves: mapping out database relations, listing specifications for the controllers, writing tests, sketching out the views...
* What's your favorite algorithm?
* What's your favorite data structure?
* What's your favorite Ruby gem (other than Rails)?

## Questions for the Interviewer

At the end of almost any interview, the interviewer will ask you what questions you have
for them. This may appear to signal the end of the interview, but this is not the case.
Because this is the only part of the conversation that you control, they will judge you
based on the questions you ask and how astute they seem.
