## Phase 1: Pick a Template

Use a template so you don't have to design anything.
  * You'll save a lot of time.
  * You're a web developer, not a web designer.
  * An ugly/poorly designed portfolio site can take you out of consideration for a position. Don't risk it!
 
#### Free Templates
  * [Free CSS Templates][free-css]
  * [HTML5 UP][html5-up]
  * [Start Bootstrap][startbs]

## Phase 2: Fill in the Details

* A short personal summary - this will be very similar to your ["personal pitch".][personal-pitch]
* A nice, well-lit picture of you. The one in the progress tracker is perfect!
* A list of your projects with short descriptions:
    * Use the keywords from your résumé
    * For each project include a live link and a link to its Github repo
* Easy access to your email and your resume
  * Link to view a PDF version of your resume
  * `<a href="path/to/resume">View my Resume</a>`
  * *I should be able to `cmd + f` 'resume' and 'email'*
* Links to your GitHub and LinkedIn
* Links to your blog / Twitter / etc. if they're well maintained and show your interest in the web/tech.

## Phase 3: Launch It!

**1. Deploy to [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)**
   * Your repo should be called 'myGithubName.github.io'
   * Place all the code for your portfolio site within this repo

**2. Register a domain**
   * We recommend [namecheap.com][namecheap] for registering domains.
   * Instructions to set up namecheap with Github pages [here][namecheap-instructions]

[namecheap]: http://www.namecheap.com/
[namecheap-instructions]: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages


**3. Set up a CNAME**
   * A [CNAME record](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) will make www.{jobseeker}.com redirect to your Github page.
