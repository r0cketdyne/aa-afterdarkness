# LinkedIn

A snappy, polished LinkedIn profile is essential during the job search, especially in the tech industry. Your LinkedIn will often be the first thing that potential employers, recruiters, and useful contacts look at as they try to evaluate your professional credentials.  

## Elements of Your LinkedIn Profile

### Summary  

The summary is one of the most important parts of your LinkedIn. Unlike the rest of your LinkedIn, it's a chance to inject some individuality and personality into your profile.  Ideally, you want it to be unique, eye-catching, professional, and personal all at the same time. Here are a couple examples to help brainstorm:

**Charles:**

"I'm a curious puzzle-solver who enjoys poring over server logs and error messages. I have a passion for software that sews together the desktop and mobile experiences. I'm an enthusiastic teammate and a patient communicator. I have a near-compulsive desire to explore the unfamiliar. My favorite languages are Ruby, Javascript, and Korean."

**Theresa:**

"Simply put, I love to code. The sleuthwork of identifying the source of a bug (especially when the error message is less than helpful). The zen-like state of refactoring tests in a massive codebase. The excitement of implementing a long-anticipated feature. The consistent vacillation between questioning and understanding. 

I have a reputation for asking great questions, shipping quality code, being a strong pair and working well across teams."

**Marc:**

"Iâ€™m a passionate software developer with the innovative and creative mindset of an entrepreneur. I have experience building dynamic web applications in JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and HTML/CSS.

I love the battle of developing an idea into existence, and forging the bridge between conceptualization and a tangible, impactful product. Programming has been my outlet for problem-solving and creative expression."

### Profile Picture  

Use a picture that's friendly, but professional. A lot of folks use their App Academy photo in their LinkedIn profile.

### Projects 

As an App Academy grad, the projects section of your LinkedIn is very important.  You can use the same bullet points that you use in your resume, but you have a little more flexibility on LinkedIn -- instead of limiting yourself to 3-4 projects, list everything substantial, polished, and complete that you've worked on.  You can (and should) include screenshots as well to show off your work, and you can be slightly more verbose when you're describing your project than you are in your resume. 

### Experience

As with your projects, you can be a bit more expansive with your previous experience than in your resume.  Include any positions that fall into any of the following categories:

- Positions that involved quantitative/technical work or research 
- Positions in which you were a supervisor or had a lot of responsibility 
- Positions that you held for > 1 year
- Positions that showcase any unique talents, skills, or knowledge that you have 

As with your resume, include a brief summary of the position and 3-5 bullet points describing your responsibilities.  When possible, get endorsements on LinkedIn from coworkers and supervisors from the positions you include.

### Education

Include anything post-high school, even if it's not a degree from a STEM field.  List your university if possible at the top so the name will be displayed in your profile summary.

### Skills

This is the place to showcase all of the technical skills that you've learned at App Academy and beyond.  List your strongest skills first (Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React should be right at the top) followed by other programming skills. Allow your connections to endorse your skills, and also endorse the skills of other students in your cohort (and your TAs!).

Make sure you include all of these:

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* React
* Flux
* SQL
* Postgresql
* Git
* HTML
* CSS
* AJAX
* Web Development
* Amazon Web Services
* Heroku
* Test Driven Development
* RSpec
* MVC Architecture
* RESTful Web Services
* Object Oriented Design
* Pair Programming

### Volunteer Experience

Most employers won't pay much attention, but it can have significant benefit if a recruiter, CEO, or hiring manager shares your passion for a particular cause.  It's an immediate personal connection that you wouldn't otherwise get.  

### Publications 

If you have any academic publications such as research papers, a thesis or dissertation, etc., definitely include these.  Anything STEM-related should go at the top of your publication list.

## Building Your LinkedIn Network 

It's to your advantage to have a broad network of connections on LinkedIn.  Once you've polished your profile, start connecting!  Your connections should include:

- Your App Academy cohort, TAs, instructors, and career coaches 
- Former colleagues and supervisors
- Former professors, teachers, advisors, and other school contacts 
- Friends, especially those who work in tech, live in a city you're interested in working in, and/or who have an extensive professional network 
- Family members 
- Networking contacts that you've met at meetups, a/A events, or elsewhere 

When in doubt, connect.  Don't refuse connections, either, except in rare cases (spam, people with job titles you personally wouldn't want to show up in your connections, etc.).

## Leveraging Your Network

If you already have a network on LinkedIn (even if it's not huge), leveraging it in your job search can be very effective.  Here's how you can go about it.

**Step 1.**  Identify a company you're interested in.  Let's go with Pandora, for instance.  Go to the company's page, and look at the **How You're Connected** box:

![pandora](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10385145/12734301/65cd1932-c8f4-11e5-9f1f-e9d08b19cc5d.png)

Click "see all" -- this shows you all the ways in which you're connected through your network to someone who works at Pandora.  

**Step 2a.**  If you have a first-degree connection who you know well enough to reach out to directly, great!  Send them a polite message asking to meet them coffee or lunch and chat about the company.  Mention that you're on the job market and you're interested in learning about the company. **Do not explicitly ask for an interview**, gather information and make your referral ask after, or towards the end of your meeting.

**Step 2b.** If you don't have a first-degree connection, take a look at your second-degree connections.  Go through each of these connections and prioritize:

1.  Could you count on this person to go to bat for you, give you a solid recommendation, and facilitate an introduction?

2.  How closely does your connection's Pandora connection match the position you'd like to apply for?  (A software engineer, engineering manager, or other member of the technical staff)

![connections](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10385145/12734388/ff955750-c8f4-11e5-97b1-73af04b99fec.png)

Now, take some action! Message your connection and ask to take them out to coffee:

"Hi Nina, 

Long time no see!  I'm writing to ask a favor. I'm currently on the job market and I'm really interested in learning more about what it's like to work at Pandora. Can I take you out for coffee and chat for a bit?  Thanks!

Annabelle"

**Step 3.** Iterate. Go to meetups, make connections, follow-up. Always be gracious and listen to the advice you receive. People are more likely to help someone that is kind and interested in them than someone who merely sees them as a stepping stone.

**BONUS: Endorse with ease...**
```javascript
const click = new MouseEvent('click', { 'bubbles': true })

const viewMore = document.querySelectorAll('.pv-skills-section__additional-skills')[0]
viewMore.dispatchEvent(click)

const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.pv-skill-entity__featured-endorse-button-shared')
Array.from(buttons).slice(0, 40).forEach(button => button.dispatchEvent(click))
```
