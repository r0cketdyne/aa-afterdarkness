# Github

## Make it personal

A strongly branded Github is more welcoming and tells employers you care about
the code you publish.    

Add your first name and last name under *settings > profile*. This makes it easier
for employers to find you and review your code.

Make sure you have a professional and recognizable profile picture. This is an easy
way to strengthen the connection with employers who review your code, and to make
sure they remember who you are after interviewing you.

You can use the picture in the progress tracker. There's a high-res download link in there.

## Migrate and format

Only your polished projects should be visible in your Github. Include all
the projects listed on your résumé to start. Ask your career coach before
you include additional projects, however it's beneficial to keep the number of repos smaller and of a higher quality so you can be sure visitors to your profile are only seeing your best work. 

For repos that aren't polished enough for public consumption you have two options.

1. Pay $7 a month for unlimited private repos on Github and make all the unpolished repos private.
2. [Migrate the repositories](http://befused.com/git/github-bitbucket-move) you want private over to [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)

You can also just remove the repos and keep the code locally on your computer. **You will lose your commits from the course, but commits made after you graduate are far more important, so don't fret!**



## Repo Hygiene

**Remove all references to projects that you originally did in class! (Instructions, Specs, Comments, etc.)**

* Rename the repos that you keep public.
* Give them enticing descriptions and useful [README's][readme].
* Make sure to remove all lines of code that you'd commented out.
* Make sure to remove all .DS_Store and .byebug_history
* Rewrite any commits that are not attributed to you. [Instructions here.](https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/ruby/readings/git-fix-authorship.md)

## Show How Active You Are

### Star repos

Start with the ones you use every day. Here are a few to get you started, but branch out and star repos from anything you're interested in:

* [rails][rails]
* [react][react]
* [rspec][rspec]
* [ruby][ruby]

You should also star any classmates' projects that you admire!

### Follow other developers

At the very least follow your classmates and instructors. Then go and follow other
developers you know and admire.

**If you all follow each other, you'll also have followers!**
