# Writing a README

**Every project on your resume needs a great README.**

__Review Github's [markdown guide][markdown-guide] before you begin__. It's incredibly important to
format your README in a professional way. Don't cut corners here or you will look inexperienced.

README's must have:

* Link to live site
* Summary of the project
* Instructions/how to play (for games)
* How to build/run the code (for technical projects)
* List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
* Technical implementation details
  * Anything you had to stop and think about before building
  * Snippets or links to see code for these (make sure it looks good, no 30 line methods)
* Screenshots for the visual projects
* To-dos/future features

Use the examples below as a general guide. **Don't copy them**.
