# Crafting Your Resume

## Phase 0: Motivation

Every student coming out of App Academy is better in practice than they look on paper. The goal here is give the impression of professional experience. A compelling resume will provide the opportunity to demonstrate technical expertise during phone screens and on-sites.

## Warmup

Go through the following steps for these [example resumes][example-resumes] from past graduates.

1. Look at the Resume for 6 seconds
2. Note the following observations:
  * What drew your eye?
  * What were their skills/technologies?
  * Would you spend a few minutes on this candidate?
3. Take a couple minutes to read it over in depth.
  * What did you miss in the 6 second test?

### Filling a Need

Imagine you are a recruiter. You need to fill positions that require certain skills and experience...

- Experience building **Single-Page Applications** in **Rails** or **Django**. Familiarity with **AWS**.

- **Gulp, npm, Webpack, Babel, Eslint, Mocha, PostCSS** are all **JS tools** that we use on a daily basis.

- Be a **Ruby on Rails** whiz and have solid expertise in front-end technologies including **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery**.

- Knowledge of current front-end **design patterns** and **best practices**; **Flux** or similar **data-flow architectures (We use Redux)**.

- Solid foundation in **computer science fundamentals**, confident building and consuming **REST APIs**.

Build your resume to grab a recruiter's attention with what you can do.

**N.B.: If a resume can't pass the 6 second test, your portfolio will never be seen!**

## Phase 1: Layout

### General Guidelines

Use the example resumes above to guide your resume template choice. You may also use [Canva][canva], [Creddle][creddle], and [these][drive-templates].

**N.B.: Submit your Resume for review through Jobberwocky as a Google Doc with edit permissions for all your coaches (mhaws@appacademy.io, dcatalano@appacademy.io)**

- We encourage you to use a professional-looking template. Stick with an easy-to-read sans-serif font. Google Docs has many to choose from, including Arial, Calibri, Droid Sans, Proxima Nova, Roboto, Trebuchet MS, Valera Round, and Verdana.

- No font sizes smaller than 11pt.

- Stick to one page and use lots of whitespace with 1-inch margins on left and right. 

#### Order

As a general guide:

1. Projects (Your experience)
2. Skills
3. Education
4. Work History

This is flexible. **If you have professional software experience (i.e. you were paid to write code), place that experience first**. If you studied computer science / are a recent grad with academic achievements you may wish to give education more prominence.

#### Include these links:

* Github
* Portfolio Site
* LinkedIn
* Projects:
    * Link to live site
    * Link to Github Repo
        
[canva]: https://www.canva.com/
[creddle]: http://creddle.io/
[drive-templates]: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3noREts_wUyMFZHWVhvcUUtU1E&authuser=0

## Phase 2: Projects

### Full Stack Project, JavaScript Project and Code Intensive

Your résumé should highlight three projects you worked on.

1. A React-on-Rails app to show you know the full stack.
2. A fun JavaScript project for non-technical reviewers to appreciate.
3. A complex, code-intensive project for technical reviewers that shows strong Object-Oriented Design skills.
    - 'code-intensive' is not an industry term, *don't write this on your resume!*

Your Full Stack Project and JavaScript Project **must** be deployed and available to view online with a live link in the resume. Otherwise they aren't serving their purpose. Projects should also include a link to their associated Github repo.

### Selling your Projects

[Read here about crafting bullet points][resume-bullets]

Follow the steps outlined above **for each bullet**. Use the following resources:
* [List of resume keywords][resume-keywords]
* [List of resume verbs][resume-verbs]

**N.B.: Every bullet should start with a verb and must include AT LEAST two resume keywords**

Your projects are your programming experience. Well-written bullets about features and enhancements you implemented will convince employers you're worth the time to interview. What matters the most are the problems you solved and the skills you applied.

### Words of Caution

* Don't be careless with spelling and capitalization. 
    - JavaScript, not Javascript. jQuery, not jquery. RSpec, not Rspec.

* Avoid extremely language or framework-specific bullets, they are incomprehensible to non-technical readers.
   - Example: "Overwrites attr_writer on User#password"

* **DO NOT** just enumerate features in your bullet points!
    - Example: "Allows Users to login / logout", "Uploads photos", "Schedules todos for user"

### Communicate as an Engineer

A good resume item does *not* read like a feature list on a product's website. Write at a higher-level about what engineering solutions you implemented. Describe *engineering problems you solved* or the solutions you found in *implementing* those features. Employers want to hear about what kind of an engineer you are and how you approach problem-solving.

### Keywords are King

[A sample resume][sans-highlights] vs. [That resume through a recruiter's eyes][highlights]


## Phase 3: Skills

List these skills, and any other relevant ones. **Anything listed is fair game in a technical interview.**

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* RSpec
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* React
* Flux (Redux)
* SQL
* Git
* HTML5
* CSS3

## Phase 4: Education

### App Academy

Now that you are an App Academy student, selling yourself requires you to sell
employers on the quality of App Academy. In your résumé, mention that App Academy is a 1000-hour coding school with an admissions
rate below 3%, which emphasizes coding style, pair programming, and best practices.

Here are some suggested bullet points for your resume. Mix and match!

* Rigorous 1000-hour software development course with <3% acceptance rate
* 1000-hour immersive full-stack web development intensive with <3% acceptance rate
* Teaches full-stack web development: Rails, SQL, JS, React, TDD, algorithms, design patterns, and programming best practices.
* Topics include: TDD, scalability, algorithms, OOP, coding style, REST, security, single-page apps, and web development best practices.

### College

If you took CS-related courses in college, add a "Curriculum Highlights" section
under the name of your degree and list those courses. Linear algebra, statistics,
and Electrical Engineering courses are also relevant.

Include your GPA if you graduated less than 5 years ago and if it's above 3.2.
If you studied a STEM subject or Econ, you can use your Major GPA if it is
higher.

### No Degree or Relevant Work Experience

Many students have graduated from App Academy without a college degree
nor relevant work experience. They are now all employed. 

It might be tougher to get through the résumé screening, but the tech industry is
famous for appreciating non-traditional backgrounds.

The key in this case is to make a strong personal impression. You don't
want the reader to come away thinking "OK they can code. But I have no
idea what else to expect from this person." You have to be creative. Have you ever done volunteer work or interesting hobbies that would make you stand out?

If it's the case, you can mention "Left college in good academic standing for financial reasons / to pursue web development."

## Phase 5: Work History

[Review crafting project bullet points][resume-bullets] and incorporate [action verbs][resume-verbs] in your bullets.

The difference between a compelling work history and a boring one is whether you have identified the *results* of your work.

Someone who can talk about outcomes:

0. Made a difference at their job
0. Cares about results 
0. Is likely to produce results at their next job.

### You're an Engineer Now

If you did coding-like technical things, talk about it. Doesn't matter if it was 10% of your job, that's the focus. Whether that be scripting, Excel analyses, financial crunching, SQL queries, working with a CMS/company website, etc. Technical experience reinforces the narrative of your transition into engineering.

### Quantify or Qualify

 The difference between:
"Wrote financial reports" vs. "Produced quarterly financial reports, to maintain relationships with 6 major account holders."

The first is the bare minimum of what was done with no indication of how it was done or what was accomplished. The second has specific benchmarks and a reason for why it was done.

Every bullet point should be quantified and/or qualified:

**Quantify**: Numbers to measure your success. "Delivered pizzas" vs. "Delivered approx. 40 pizzas in each 4-hour shift"

**Qualify**: Specific reasons for why and how you were successful. "Served dinner" vs. "Wrote a new salad recipe that replaces bacon with cucumbers, to please a health-conscious client."

Simply describing something that sounds like success is a big plus. Consider the following blurbs.

*Wrote scripts to test new product before shipping.*

vs.

*Wrote Bash scripts to test new product before shipping. Achieved 90% test coverage, resulting in bug-free launch.*

Who knows if that's a meaningful benchmark? Maybe there weren't that many
features. Or maybe the product still had bugs and they just didn't turn up
during the launch. The key here is that you get to frame it. Position yourself as a winner.

### Quality over Quantity

Describing results takes more space. Two longer
bullet points that convey success are much stronger than four bullet
points that only describe process *no matter what portion of your
previous job you're leaving out*.

## Phase 6: Review

Before you submit your résumé for review, make sure you can answer yes to all these questions.

**N.B. Address these so your career coach can give substantive personal feedback**

* **Layout**

  0. Fits on 1 page?
  0. 1-inch margins on left and right?

  0. Uses a sans serif font?

* **Projects**

  0. Do you list three or four coding projects, including your Full Stack Project, JavaScript project, and Code Intensive?
  0. Does each project include a link to the Github repo and one to the live demo (if applicable)?
  0. Do you describe clever solutions you came up with to build each project?
  0. Does each bullet include at least two [keywords][resume-keywords]?

* **Work**

  0. Do you describe not just *what* you did at each job but *how well* you did it?
  0. Do you provide benchmarks for your own or your teams success?
  0. Do you emphasize technical or programmatic aspects of your work history?

* **Misc**

  0. Do your bullets follow the formula: Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]?
  0. Do you provide a skills list of the technologies you are familiar with?
  0. Do you provide contact information and link to your Github and LinkedIn?
  0. Does your contact information make it clear you are currently in the metro area? (Use a/A office address if this is not the case)
  0. Is it a Google Doc where you have granted edit access for your career coach?
  0. Have you eliminated or minimized any timeline gaps in your resume?
