Jobberwocky is a tool to organize your search and provide career coaches insight into your progress. By keeping it up-to-date, career coaches will understand how to provide the support you need.

## Application Material Reviews

You will submit the following 6 items for review through Jobberwocky:

* Resume
* Cover Letter
* Full Stack Project
* JavaScript Project
* Code Intensive
* Portfolio Site

Career coaches will review projects, add Todos, and send them back to you for additional work. Continue to iterate on your portfolio materials until they are marked `complete`. The faster you address material Todos, the more feedback you'll receive.

## Adding Companies

Even before you start sending applications, research companies you plan to apply to. Develop a plan of which industries you're excited about and why you would be a great addition to the team. In the `Job Application` tab, click the blue `+` to input information on the company. `Ranking` and `Company Name` are required, the rest are available for your own purposes. `Create Job App` submits the application to Jobberwocky.

Rank the company 1 to 3
  * 3 means "Not dying to work there" or "Don't know enough about them." (50%)
  * 2 means "Looks like a cool place". (35%)
  * 1 means "Very excited to work there". (15%)

## Keeping it up to date

The status of your applications allows coaches to see at a glance how you're doing and when to provide support.

* "Will Apply" until you send your application.
* "Applied" once your application is sent.
* "Pre On-Site" after a phone call.
* "Interviewed" after your On-Site.
* "Offered" once you receive an offer.
* "Accepted Offer", congratulations!
