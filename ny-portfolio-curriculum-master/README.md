# NY Job Search - Portfolio Curriculum

This is the culmination of the hard work you've put in during the past 9 weeks. The focus will be on developing your portfolio, networking ability, and CS fundamentals in order to land interviews and excel during those opportunities. The following three weeks will be less structured and push you to develop a self-sufficiency which is crucial for the job search. **You can do it!**
