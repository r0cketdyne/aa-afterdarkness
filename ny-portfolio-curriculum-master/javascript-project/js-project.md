# JavaScript Project

**[Proposals][js-proposal] are due W10D3 at 9AM**

The purpose of this project is to have something visually compelling, interactive, and
user-friendly to impress recruiters and other non-technical people. You will show off
your mastery of JavaScript and object-oriented design.

You will choose a JS project that's reasonable to complete with about **3 days of work**, but
also stands out as unique. This can be a hard balance to strike, so think carefully about
your choice.

Your project should be at should be at least as technically impressive as Asteroids or Snake.
Something like TicTacToe or Towers of Hanoi is not complex enough. However, **you may not
choose Snake or Asteroids**. Employers see these two games too often from bootcamp grads and
sometimes even use them as a means of screening out candidates in the early stages of the
application process.

Additionally, you may **not** use online tutorials or the Phaser.js library to create your game.
Tutorials often give you a lot of code snippets. At best, it looks like you don't actually know
how to write code yourself, and, at worst, it looks like you plagiarized someone else's work.

Feel free to reference previous cohort's projects, but **do not copy code from another person's repo.**

## Proposal

[Sample proposal][js-proposal] for inspiration.

Create a new repo to hold your JS project and submit through Jobberwocky
**by 9AM W10D3**. Your README must include the following:

### MVP

Write a one-sentence summary of the project and a list of the features that are
absolutely necessary. Order these by importance and use the list to guide your development.

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs

How will you architect the game? Will it use vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS or will you use
a library like React? Will you use any other libraries or API's? Summarize the technical
challenges you anticipate and how you plan to solve them.

### Wireframes

This will be a lot less involved than for your Full Stack Project, but make sure you have drawings
for each view, including modals.

### Backend

If your project is going to have a backend, outline the db schema and models needed.

### Implementation Timeline

This will be the road map for your application. You have about three days for this
project. Refer to your MVP and group the features into __three phases__. Break down each
phase into several sub-tasks to keep yourself organized.

You should have a working app at the end of each phase (even if not all of your
features are in yet).
