# Job Search Curriculum Strikes 

After the end of Week 9, your Coding Curriculum strikes will be nullified and you will be subject to the Job Search Curriculum strike system.  

Consider this a last resort, our hope is that these never come into play. The goal is to place students into a full-time position as a result of their hard work and dedication. Please refer to your signed Job Search Agreement for detailed instructions on what is expected. 

The following behaviors can result in Job Search Curriculum strikes:

- Lateness or absence from daily check-ins during the Job Search Curriculum (weeks 10-12).
- Failure to respond to an email or phone call from your career coach within 1 business day.
- Missing an appointment with your career coach.
- Submitting fewer than the required quota of job applications (typically 40/week).
- Failure to submit materials for review through [Jobberwocky][jobberwocky].
- Leaving the job search area (Manhattan or Brooklyn) without the approval of your career coach.
- Failure to meet a project deadline set by your career coach.
- Failure to keep [Jobberwocky][jobberwocky] up to date.
- **Plagiarism will result in immediate dismissal from the course and conversion to flat rate tuition.**

You will remain accountable to the Job Search Curriculum strike system until you have found a job, or 1 year has passed.  Your Job Search strike count will reduce by 1 strike a week each Friday. You may accummulate up to 4 Job Search strikes.  Accummulating 5 or more strikes will result in a conversion of your tuition model from a percentage of your first year's salary to a flat fee, for which you will be billed immediately.
