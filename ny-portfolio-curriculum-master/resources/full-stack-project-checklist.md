# Full Stack Project Checklist

This is the centerpiece of your portfolio. Hold yourself to a high standard and use the checklist below as guidance.

## Layout and CSS
- [ ] Make sure the layout is like the site you're cloning.
- [ ] Every page, no matter how insignificant, must be styled.
- [ ] Use a classy font, no Arial or Times New Roman. [Google Fonts][google-fonts] are a good choice.
- [ ] Style :hover actions of input, buttons and links, to show you can click on things. More visual feedback!
- [ ] Style your input, textarea and button tags (use the same font, color, etc. as the rest of your app).
- [ ] Use a consistent design everywhere, even if minimal, rather than something fancy here and there.
- [ ] Do **not** use any dead-links or placeholders. Every button, link, etc. must do something.

## Hosting
- [ ] Use your own custom domain (no herokuapps.com subdomain).
- [ ] Your dyno should stay awake by upgrading to a 'hobby dyno', otherwise it can take 30+ seconds to load.

## Data
- [ ] Well groomed seed data (real world stuff, no lorem ipsum).
- [ ] Have a guest account (or two, if you need both to demo).
- [ ] Use your seed data to welcome the Guest User to your site and introduce yourself (link to your Github, LinkedIn, etc).

## UX
- [ ] User interactions must be acknowleged by providing visual feedback of success and failure.
- [ ] User interactions should have the affordance of `cursor: pointer` CSS.
- [ ] **Ask another student to walk through your app.** See where they struggle to understand features. Return this favor!

## Repo
- [ ] Remove `.byebug_history` and `.DS_Store` and add them to `.gitignore`.
- [ ] Remove all commented out code, `console.log` statements, and `debugger` statements.
- [ ] Have a high quality README which emphasizes your technical implementations.
