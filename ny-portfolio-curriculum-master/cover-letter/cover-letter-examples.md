Hi Spotify Team, 

I’m a web developer with experience in Ruby, JavaScript and React.js, and a background in music composition and technology. I’m looking for new opportunities to create innovative web solutions that transform the music industry and impact the way the world experiences music. 

My latest project is SoundCloned, an audio hosting and streaming app inspired by Soundcloud. The app leverages a lean audio stack — HTML5 audio enhanced and centralized with React and Flux — in order to provide the user with a seamless listening experience. Playback responsibilities are divided between two Flux cycles, one for time information and the other for audio, making the app exceptionally fast when it comes to switching between songs at arbitrary points in playback. AJAX integration and a modular component architecture allow users to navigate around the site freely while audio plays continuously.

If you’d like to know more about my past and current projects, please visit my LinkedIn and portfolio sites.  Thank you for your consideration, and I’m excited to discuss job opportunities at Spotify with you. 

Best wishes,
Jim Jarmusch

Dear True Link,

I am an NYC-based web developer with experience in Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. I am
interested in your Full-Stack developer position. Guiding people through their financial landscape is a
wonderful effort that I would like to be part of! As someone with investment experience, I understand
the emotional challenges of navigating financial difficulties and would like to be part of the team that
empower people to control and maintain their financial health.

My most recent application is DashboardAlpha (dbalpha.info) where I served as the product owner
and full-stack engineer. It was a SeekingAlpha-inspired investment research dashboard that
aggregated information and aimed to help mom-and-pop investors manage their thoughts on individual
securities. I designed an algorithm to dynamically alter displayed content with varying window sizes. I
also customized a Backbone.js library to query data from Yahoo! and used Ruby on Rails gems to
access Google-search APIs to present updated information of all US stocks.

Another application that I built was Breakout.js, a game that challenges players to clear a brick field
with a ball. I served as the front-end engineer and used HTML5 canvas to present a dynamic game
display and utilized multiple event listeners to give users multiple control methods. I also leveraged
CSS3 features to present a tabbed menu to display game information. I developed computations of
kinematics behavior, including friction, drag, and dot products, to enhance user experience with real-
physics-like movements.

I would love to apply my software development skills to help move True Link forward. If you have
any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Sally P. Example

Dear XYZ,

I am a web developer with experience using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, API Integration, PostgreSQL, RSpec and Capybara. Music has influenced my entire life; I grew up in Woodstock, and have seen the impact of the changes within the industry on family and friends. SoundCloud’s essentially free hosting gives artists massive exposure, which is more important now than ever. My skillset and experience can address and solve optimization issues with efficiency and grace.

My most recent project was a blogger site Connect, based on Medium. It’s deployed on Heroku as a Rails JSON API feeding a React frontend. Using React as a framework allowed me to build a dynamic, single-page web app while standardizing my dataflow with Redux. I implemented client-side and server-side user validations. My frontend requests were all optimized so that I never duplicated any queries, and I used ActiveRecord associations on the backend to package any data I’d need and eliminate any N + 1 queries.
I set a very optimistic deadline, that required solving problems rapidly. It made me happy to see that you pair at Soundcloud. During my work on Connect, pairing really helped me. I was running into an issue with a selector that should’ve selected the stories from users the current user followed, but of course it wasn’t. As soon as I talked through the problem with someone else, the issue (I wasn’t parsing the int- so I was forever looking for a string) became immediately clear. Thirty minutes later we went through my partner’s code and managed to fix a problem with his page not re­rendering after edits.

If you’d like to see more of my current and past projects, please visit my LinkedIn and GitHub. My goal is to ship code as quickly as possible without sacrificing its stability. Our values match up well and I would be thrilled to solve large­scale problems at SoundCloud. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

FRONTEND

Hi WIRED Brand Lab,

I’m a New York-based web developer with experience developing web apps with a React.js and Redux frontend and a backend built on Ruby on Rails and a PostgreSQL database. I am currently looking for opportunities developing exceptional web design, focusing on the overall user experience for impactful advertising campaigns on the web.

My latest project, Interlude, is a streaming music app inspired by Spotify. I had the sole responsibility of developing the entire application, with particular attention paid to the front end and user experience design. The app balances two major components to create a seamless music listening experience: while one component oversees the audio element, the other manages a queue of songs so that the user can dynamically add and remove songs as they navigate the site.

I understand that WIRED Brand Lab is looking for a candidate who uses best practices in keeping JS code modular and loosely coupled. I also know that WIRED Brand Lab is looking for people who are technically pro cient as well as collaborative. I am happy to say that I exhibit both qualities, especially as a student at App Academy, where I developed a practice test for my classmates as we prepared for a Ruby assessment.

I look forward to hearing about how I can help WIRED Brand Lab create user-centered web solutions. You can reach me on LinkedIn or via the contact information provided above.

Best,

BACKEND

Hi Betterment Team,

I’m a New York-based web developer with experience developing web apps with a React.js and Redux frontend with a backend built on Ruby on Rails and a PostgreSQL database. I’m looking for opportunities to use what I know in software development to provide highly e cient investment technologies for customers.

My latest project is Interlude, a streaming music app inspired by Spotify. It prioritizes the user experience by leveraging clean code and lean programming while emphasizing data parsing on the backend to reduce front-end load times. A major challenge was to implement the extraction of audio metadata during the initial saving of records in the database. I accomplished this by using the Mp3Info Ruby gem instead of relying on the frontend application to load and parse mp3 metadata. Additionally, the app emphasizes a seamless user experience with playlist CRUD through the use of contextual menus. You can see the app here.

I would love to use the wide set of tools I have to tackle Betterment’s software engineering challenges. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Hi Genius Team,

I am an NYC-based web developer with experience in Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript and a background in finance and law. Genius is on the forefront of reimagining the way people consume information and receive analysis on the web. I believe that my experience applying and using technology in professional environments can help Genius expand beyond lyrics and annotate the web.

My latest project is CaseNote, an app where users can access and contribute to a crowd-sourced collection of court opinions and legal knowledge. The app has a Genius-inspired annotation scheme that allows users to annotate opinions to provide insight and analysis. I engineered CaseNote with an emphasis on user experience. For example, in order to create a opinion page that is seamless and responsive, I implemented conditional rendering of React components, utilized Redux for state management, deployed event listeners on multiple components, and customized the Quill rich-text editor to create and render annotations. Because of this, users can view and edit an opinion and its annotations, make new annotations, and view users’ suggestions on annotations—all on a single page.

If you’d like to know more about my projects, please visit my LinkedIn and portfolio sites. Thank you for your consideration, and I’m excited to discuss opportunities at Genius with you.

Best wishes,

Dear NetCloudTek Team,

I am a web developer based in New York City with a background in creating apps with SQL, JavaScript, and Ruby. I have experience with scaling large databases and maintaining synchronicity between front and back ends of an application while optimizing my code to reduce requests made to the database and improve user experience.

Creating software that works quickly and accurately reduces performance bottlenecks and optimizes performance. On my most recent project, Remember The Mango, I was able to optimize the loading time of my entire app through eager loading and e cient SQL queries. I used a PostgreSQL database for the Rails JSON API to feed AJAX requests for the React-Redux front-end to consume, making a responsive and e cient app.

In a previous role, I developed and maintained an Access database to track the progress of international students from their  rst contact through alumni status. As the only member of my team, I implemented the planning, design, implementation, and testing of the database in a timely manner while maintaining all available data. My work increased the productivity of the o ce, improved student relations, and replaced an ine cient paper system.

My past experiences have provided me with the technical skills required for this job and the ability to learn and apply new technologies quickly. I believe I am a positive, talented, and invigorating presence on any team and would be happy to apply my knowledge and skill-set in an challenging and dynamic environment such as NetCloudTek.

Thank you very much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

Hello Priceline Team,

I am a web developer based in New York City with a background in creating apps with JavaScript, MVC frameworks like Rails, and front-line libraries such as React and Redux. I have experience with scaling databases and maintaining synchronicity between front and back ends of an application while optimizing my code to reduce requests made to the database and improve user experience.

I love creating software that is attractive and responsive. I was able to show o  my front end skills in my most recent project, Remember The Mango. I achieved smooth transitions and responsive design through integrating the server- and client-side using a RESTful API and React.js. I created my front-end using a creative and concise application of HTML5 and CSS3 resulting in a professional and thoughtful web application.

To optimize the loading time of my entire app, I utilized eager loading and e cient SQL queries. I used a PostgreSQL database for the Rails JSON API to feed AJAX requests for the React-Redux frontend to consume, making a responsive and e cient app.

In a past role, I used Drupal to overhaul the websites of several o ces who had not had a technically trained person work on them in some years. I was successful in creating attractive and functional interfaces that better communicated those o ces’ purpose to the community while managing the e ects of several years worth of ine cient design.

My past experiences have provided me with the technical skills needed to succeed in this position and the ability to learn and apply new technologies quickly. I believe I am a positive, talented, and invigorating presence on any team and would be happy to apply my knowledge and skill-set in such technically collaborative and front-line team such as Priceline.

Thank you very much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
