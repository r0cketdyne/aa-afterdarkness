# The Cover Letter

## Phase 0: Homework (Do this in advance)
:closed_lock_with_key: `go_video_go`
* :movie_camera: [SF Lecture](https://vimeo.com/182749397) (27 min)
* Identify two NY tech companies.
 * Pick one position focused on front-end
 * Pick one position focused on back-end
* Spend 15 minutes researching the company (use their own site, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Google).

For each company write down the following:

1. What does the company do?
2. What are they doing that makes them better/different than their competitors?
2. Why are you interested in working there?
3. Why does your skillset and background make you a good candidate?

## Phase 1: Motivation
[See some example cover letters][cover letters]

[cover letters]: https://github.com/appacademy/ny-portfolio-curriculum/tree/master/cover-letter/cover-letter-examples.md

A cover letter sets you apart as someone who is serious about the position.
Aside from due diligence, the purpose is to quickly describe yourself as a viable candidate.
Employers scan the cover letter and pick up on keywords ("Rails", "fast-paced", "team"...) that suggest you know what you're doing.
By making a brief connection with the company's values, you're harder to ignore.

Be short and to the point, your portfolio will do the heavy lifting.

## Phase 2: Opening Paragraph

**Introduce yourself, the technologies you know, and your interest in the position**

* Use the same header as your resume.
* If you don't know the hiring manager's name, start with "Hi #{Company Name} Team".
* Open by saying you're a web developer with experience in the relevant technologies.
  * React, Rails, JavaScript, SQL, CSS, Redux, etc.
* A sentence about your background if it is applicable. *(Science, Engineering, Mathematics, CS)*
* Include a sentence or two specific to your interest in the company and its values. Hopefully, you have a genuine interest and connection with companies to which you apply. Clearly communicating this connection can be the difference between receiving a phone screen or not.

## Phase 3: Project Paragraph

**Describe your project and show you're an engineer capable of filling their position**

* Avoid unsubstantiated fluff or unrelated experience.
* Focus on the highlights of your project and your relevant skills.
  * This should be very similar to your [resume bullet points][resume-bullets].
  * Provide context - What's the problem you were trying to fix? Action - what action did you take to solve this problem? Result - how did you solution fix/benefit/improve your Full Stack Project?
* Provide a live link to your Full Stack Project.

## Phase 4: Closing Remarks

* Thank them for their time and reiterate your interest in the company / position.
* Include a live link to your portfolio site.
* Mention the materials you're sending along: résumé + github + link to a live project.

## Phase 5: Formatting

* Use at least 11pt font.
* Use the same font as your Resume.
* Use the same header as your Resume.

## Phase 6: Common Pitfalls

**No But's**

* "I don't have much experience, but I can learn very fast."
* "I don't have a CS degree, but I built a lot of cool stuff."

All a recruiter reads is "I don't have much experience, I don't have a CS
degree". Cover letters are meant to sell you. Only include positive details
about yourself.

**Save Your Story For Later**

Don't include your life history in your cover letter.  Recruiters want to know your skills and qualifications first, and will ask about your story when they get you on the phone.  Save your story for your personal pitch.

## Phase 7: Company Specific Blurb

If you spend five minutes on a job application, four of those should be for scanning the
Wikipedia article about the industry they're in and the company website and picking out buzzwords. Most companies have an "About Us" section of their site where you can read about their values.

**Consider these examples:**

*Show knowledge of the industry*
* Weak: "I am excited to apply to GeneriCo because we both value high quality code and making awesome products."  
* Strong: "A cloud-based point of sale allows businesses to centralize their transaction data.  I would love to help build GeneriCo's product and bring retail to the cloud."

*Show understanding of their challenges*
* Weak: "I enjoy shopping online and especially like it when the experience is streamlined like on your site."  
* Strong: "GeneriCo's userbase is growing fast.  I've dealt with scaling databases and leveraged my mathematics background to develop faster algorithms that enabled further growth."

## Phase 8: Bring It All Together

Write two cover letters for the companies you researched.
The difference is mainly in your company specific sections and their roles (front-end vs. back-end).

## Phase 9: Review Your Letter For Common Pitfalls

**N.B. Address these so your career coach can give substantive personal feedback instead of rehashing project guidelines**

Before submitting your two cover letters to Jobberwocky:

- [ ] Your cover letter is one page or shorter.
- [ ] Uses the same font as your Resume, and should be at least 11 point font.  
- [ ] Uses the same header as your Resume.
- [ ] Only includes positive language that sells you as a candidate.  Excludes negative language that downplays your skills (“I don’t have much experience/a CS Degree, but I can . . .”).   
- [ ] Includes the skills paragraphs that are relevant to the job description.  
- [ ] Minimize or leave out non-relevant aspects of your background.
- [ ] Is addressed to the right person/company.
- [ ] Doesn’t have typos or broken links.  
- [ ] Includes a company blurb that is specific to the company and doesn’t sound generic.
- [ ] Both cover letters are included on a single Google Doc with edit privileges for your career coach.


## BONUS: Emailing like a boss

**Etiquette**

Some companies don't provide exact instructions on how to apply. If that's the
case and you're applying via email, include your cover letter and résumé as
attachments and also paste your cover letter in the body of the email.

The subject line is just to find your email in an crowded inbox. "Junior Rails
Engineer - New York" is more helpful than "Applying to CoolCompany, inc".

**Signatures**

Set up a signature with your mail client. Include the link to your portfolio site.

You could try something like this:

    Mark Zuckerberg
    markzuckerberg.com
    @finkd
