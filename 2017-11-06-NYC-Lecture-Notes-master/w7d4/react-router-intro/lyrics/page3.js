      Every challenge along the way <br />
      With courage I will face <br />
      I will battle every day <br />
      To claim my rightful place <br />
      Come with me, the time is right <br />
      There's no better team <br />
      Arm in arm, we'll win the fight <br />
      It's always been our dream <br />
