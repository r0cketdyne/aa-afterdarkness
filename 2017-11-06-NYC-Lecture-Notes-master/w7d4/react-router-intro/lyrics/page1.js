      I want to be the very best <br />
      Like no one ever was <br />
      To catch them is my real test <br />
      To train them is my cause <br />
      I will travel across the land <br />
      Searching far and wide <br />
      Teach pok√©mon to understand <br />
      The power that's inside <br />
