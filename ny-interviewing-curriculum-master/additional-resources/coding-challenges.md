# Coding Challenges

Companies can send coding challenges before bringing candidates in for an on-site. Varying in complexity and time-investment, they're opportunities to show a company your technical ability without the stress of coding with an audience.

## General Advice

* "Bonuses" should be viewed as requirements. You're being judged aside other candidates.
* Companies almost always underestimate how long their challenge will take.
* Hold yourself to a high standard. Clean code, well-organized, clearly documented.
  * Company's perspective: Submission is code written to **get** a job, what will you write when you *have* a job...

## Common Challenges

Every company has something different, but challenges generally fall into these categories...
