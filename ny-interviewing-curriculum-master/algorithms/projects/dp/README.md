# Dynamic Programming

Today we'll learn a technique that combines an old tool, recursion, with a new idea, memoization. This topic relies heavily on recursion, so if you're feeling rusty, do these two readings first:

1. [Recursion Review](./project/recursion.md)
2. [Recursive Time Complexity](./project/recursive_time_complexity.md)

Then, get started with Dynamic Programming!
