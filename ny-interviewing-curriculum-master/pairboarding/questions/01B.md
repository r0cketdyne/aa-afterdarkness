## Introduction

Walk me through your background.

**NB**: Do your personal pitch.  You're applying for a front end position at an adtech company.

## Initiative

Tell me about a time when you took initiative.

**NB**: The interviewer wants to hear that you are independent and resourceful.

## `reverse`

Write a function that reverses the characters in a string.

**Clarify if asked:**
* You may not use the built in `reverse` method
* Solution should have O(n) time complexity

**Follow-up Questions:**
* What is the time complexity of changing a character in a string?
  * Note: Ruby strings, unlike JavaScript, are mutable

```ruby
def reverse(str)
  chars = str.chars
  n = chars.length

  (0..(n / 2).each do |idx|
    chars[idx], chars[n - idx - 1] = chars[n - idx - 1], chars[idx]
  end

  chars.join('')
end
```

```javascript
function reverse(str) {
  const chars = str.split('')
  const n = chars.length

  for (let i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
    let t = chars[i]
    chars[i] = chars[n - i - 1]
    chars[n - i - 1] = t
  }

  return chars.join('')
}
```

## `sum_rec`

Write a function that takes an array of integers and recursively computes the sum.

**Clarify if needed:**
* Time complexity should be O(n)

**Hints**
* What is the base case?
* What is the result of `sum_rec([])`?
* What is the time complexity of `#slice`, `#drop`, etc?
  * (It's O(n), so if we `#drop` on each recursive call, time complexity bumps
    to O(n ^ 2))
* How can we avoid creating a new array each time?

```ruby
def sum_rec(nums)
  return 0 if nums.empty?
  nums[0] + sum_rec(nums.drop(1))
end

def sum_rec2(nums, idx = 0)
  return 0 if idx >= nums.length

  nums[idx] + sum_rec(nums, idx + 1)
end
```

```javascript
function sumRecur(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) return 0;

  return arr[0] + sumRecur(arr.slice(1));
}

function sumRecur2(arr, head = 0, tail = arr.length, acc = 0) {
  if (head === tail) return acc;
  return sumRecur2(arr, head + 1, tail, acc + arr[head]);
}
```

* Is sumRecur2 preferable to sumRecur? Why?
