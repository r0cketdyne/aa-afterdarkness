## Introduction

Walk me through your background.

(Assume you are applying to Coursera)

## Staying Current

How do you stay up to date on the latest libraries, languages, and technologies?

## `permutations`

Write a method that takes an array and returns all its
permutations. Time/memory complexity should be proportional to the
number of permutations; what is this?

```ruby
# O(n!)
def permutations(arr)
  return [[]] if arr.empty?

  perms = []
  arr.length.times do |i|
    # Choose an element to be first
    el = arr[i]
    rest = arr.take(i) + arr.drop(i + 1)

    # Find permutations of the rest, and tack the first `el` at front.
    new_perms = permutations(rest).map { |perm| perm.unshift(el) }
    perms.concat(new_perms)
  end

  perms
end
```

**TODO**: Write a class, `PermutationIterator`, that will iterate
through permutations of an array. It should use `O(n)` memory, and
return the "next" permutation in `O(1)` time. It can iterate through
permutations in whatever order you desire.
