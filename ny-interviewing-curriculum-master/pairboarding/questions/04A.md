## Introduction

How did you get to where you are today?

*Assume you are applying to Google.*

## Take the Challenge!

What's a feature or project that you found particularly challenging?

Your answer should include the following:

- A summary of the project or feature (mention the technologies you used)
- What aspect of the project/feature made it challenging?
- What was your thought process?
- Were you able to implement exactly what you wanted, something better, or some modification to it?

## `uniq subs`

Write a method that finds all the unique substrings for a word.

```ruby
def uniq_subs(str)
  subs = Set.new 

  str.length.times do |i|
    (i...str.length).each do |j|
      subs.add(str[i..j])
    end
  end

  subs.to_a
end
```

```javascript
function uniqSubs(str) {
  const subs = new Set();

  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < str.length; j++) {
      subs.add([str.slice(i, j + 1)]);
    }
  }
  return Array.from(subs.values()) 
}
```

## `largest contiguous subsum`

Given an array of integers, find the largest sum of a subarray.

Try to solve it in `O(n)` time with `O(1)` memory.

Clarify if asked:
* Integers are positive and negative

**Hint**:

Say for an array of `n` elements you know:

* The largest contiguous subsum, AND
* The largest contiguous subsum **ending at the last of `n`
  elements**.

Now, say that you extend the `n` elements with an `n+1`th element. How
does the largest contiguous subsum ending at the `n+1`th element
change?

How does the largest contiguous subsum change?

Illustration:


```
Suppose your array is [5, 3, -7, 6], then:

* The largest subsum is 8 with subarray [5, 3].
* The largest subsum ending at the last element is 7 with subarray [5, 3, -7, 6].

Say that you push 4 to the array to get [5, 3, -7, 6, 4].

* The largest subsum ending at the last element is 11 with subarray [5, 3, -7, 6, 4].
* The largest subsum overall is the max of the old largest subsum AND the new largest subsum.
In other words, the new largest sum is 11 because [8, 11].max = 11.
```
```ruby
def lcs(arr)
  current_sum = 0
  max = arr.first || 0  # return 0 for empty array

  arr.each do |el|
    current_sum += el
    max = current_sum if max < current_sum
    current_sum = 0 if current_sum < 0
  end

  max
end
```

```ruby
def lcs(arr)
  lcs_helper(arr)[:best_sum]
end

def lcs_helper(arr)
  if arr.empty?
    return { best_sum: 0, best_suffix_sum: 0 }
  end

  result = lcs_helper(arr.drop(1))
  old_best_sum, old_best_suffix_sum = result[:best_sum], result[:best_suffix_sum]
  new_best_suffix_sum = [old_best_suffix_sum + arr.first, arr.first].max
  new_best_sum = [old_best_sum, new_best_suffix_sum].max

  { best_sum: new_best_sum,
    best_suffix_sum: new_best_suffix_sum }
end
```
