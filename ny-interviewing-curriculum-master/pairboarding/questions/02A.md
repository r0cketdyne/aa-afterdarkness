## Introduction

Give me a summary of who you are and what you've done.

*Assume you are applying to Airbnb.*

## Bugged Out

Tell me about the hardest bug you've ever resolved.

Your answer should be a narrative that the interviewer can easily follow:

- Summarize the bug
  - The project you were working on
  - The desired behavior vs. what was happening.
  - Technical details as are necessary.
- What did you try?  What didn't work?  
- What did you discover was causing the bug?
- What did you learn? How did this make you a better developer?

## `fibs`

Write a function which returns the first `n` elements from the Fibonacci sequence.

**Just a reminder:**
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...`

with the the kth element being: `f(k) = f(k - 1) + f(k - 2)`

**Hints:**
- What is the base case?
  - There are 3: 
  ```
  n = 0: []
  n = 1: [0]
  n = 2: [0, 1]
  ```

**Follow-up questions:**
- If they used an iterative solution... How can this be done recursively?
- If they used an recursive solution... How can this be done iteratively?
- What are the benefits/drawbacks of each solution?

```ruby
def fibs(num)
  fib_nums = [0, 1]
  return fib_nums.take(num) if num < 2

  while fib_nums.count < num
    fib_nums << fib_nums[-1] + fib_nums[-2]
  end

  fib_nums
end

def fibs_rec(num)
  fib_nums = [0, 1]
  return fib_nums.take(num) if num < 2

  fib_nums = fibs_rec(num - 1)
  fib_nums << fib_nums[-1] + fib_nums[-2]
  
  fib_nums 
end
```

```javascript
function fibs(num) {
  const fibNums = [0, 1]
  
  if (num < 2)
    return fibNums.slice(0, num + 1)

  while (fibNums.length < num) {
    const nextFib = fibNums[fibNums.length - 1] + fibNums[fibNums.length - 2]
    fibNums.push(nextFib);
  }

  return fibNums;
}

function fibsRec(num) {
  let fibNums = [0, 1]

  if (num < 2)
    return fibNums.slice(0, num + 1)

  fibNums = fibsRec(num - 1)
  const nextFib = fibNums[fibNums.length - 1] + fibNums[fibNums.length - 2]
  fibNums.push(nextFib)

  return fibNums
}
```

## `isPalindrome`

Write a function that returns whether a string is a palindrome. Use JavaScript.

**Reminder:**
A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards and backwards.

**Hints:**
- If a string is the same forwards and backwards, what can we say about the
  first and last characters?

**Follow-up Questions:**
- (If they used `#reverse`) How can this be done with O(1) space complexity?
- (If they didn't use `#reverse`) How can this be done without directly comparing characters?

```js
// the slick way, but it uses O(n) memory
function isPalidrome1(str) {
  return str === str.split('').reverse().join('')
}

// the less slick way, but constant space ;)
function isPalindrome2(string) {
  const n = string.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
    if (string[i] !== string[n - i - 1]) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```

## `duplicates`

Write a method that takes an array and returns its duplicate values.

**Examples:**
```ruby
duplicates([1,2,1,4]) # => [1]
duplicates([]) # => []
duplicates(["hey", "you", 4, "gonna be a big A", :potato]) # => []
```

**Hints:**
- What type of collection has constant lookup/set methods?

**Follow-up Questions:**
- What if we want to preserve the order of our dupes?
- Can we do this with constant space? How does it impact our time complexity?

```ruby
# order not important
def duplicates(arr)
  values = Set.new 
  dupes = Set.new

  arr.each do |value|
    if values[value]
      dupes << value
    else
      values << value
    end
  end

  return dupes.to_a
end

# preserves ordering
def duplicates(arr)
  values = {}
  dupes = []

  arr.each do |value|
    dupes << value if values[value] == 1

    if values[value]
      values[value] += 1
    else
      values[value] = 1
    end
  end

  return dupes 
end
```

```javascript
function duplicates(arr) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const duplicates = new Set();

  arr.forEach(el => {
    if (seen.has(el)) {
      duplicates.add(el)
    } else {
      seen.add(el)
    }
  });
  
  return Array.from(duplicates);
}
```
