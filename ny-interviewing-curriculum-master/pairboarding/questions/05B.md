## Introduction

What kind of position are you looking for (frontend, backend, fullstack)? Why?

*Assume you are applying to Lyft.*

## Hindsight

What would you do differently if you had to do [Project X] over again?

**NB:** Project X should be your fullstack project?

The answer should tell the interviewer:

- What the project was (concisely)
- A description of what you did that wasn't ideal
- A description of how you would do that differently, including an explanation of why (what did you learn after the project?)

## `binary_search`

Implement binary search iteratively (no recursion!)

**Hints:**
* Binary search eliminates half of the data set each iteration
* With recursion, we were making copies of smaller arrays...
* What's the difference?
  * `[1, 3, 5, 7].slice(0, 2)` vs. `const arrStart = 0, arrEnd = 1`
    * One gives us a new array back
    * The other gives us where that subArray would start and end within the context of the original array...

```ruby
def binary_search(array, target)
  left = 0
  right = array.length - 1

  while left <= right
    mid = (left + right) / 2
    probe = array[mid]

    return mid if probe == target

    right = mid - 1 if probe > target
    left = mid + 1 if probe < target
  end

  nil
end
```

```javascript
function bSearch(arr, target) {
  let leftIdx = 0;
  let rightIdx = arr.length - 1;

  while (leftIdx <= rightIdx) {
    const midIdx = Math.floor((leftIdx + rightIdx) / 2);
    const el = arr[midIdx];

    if (el === target) {
      return midIdx;
    } else if (el > target) {
      rightIdx = midIdx - 1;
    } else {
      leftIdx = midIdx + 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}
```

## `productify`

Given a list of numbers in an array, replace all the numbers with the
product of all other numbers.

* Do this in `O(n)` time.
* Do not use division.
* Example: [2, 3, 6] => [18, 12, 6]

**Hints:**
* We can iterate multiple times over an array and keep `O(n)` complexity...
* We can iterate from the back to the front, what does that give us?

```ruby
def productify(arr)
  # Build two arrays
  # * `left_arr[i]` is the product of all `arr[j]` for `j < i`
  # * `right_arr` is the product of all `arr[j]` for `j > i`
  products = Array.new(arr.length, 1)

  lower_prod = 1
  0.upto(arr.size - 1) do |i|
    products[i] = products[i] * lower_prod
    lower_prod = lower_prod * arr[i]
  end

  upper_prod = 1
  (arr.size - 1).downto(0) do |i|
    products[i] = products[i] * upper_prod
    upper_prod = upper_prod * arr[i]
  end

  products
end
```

```javascript
function productify(arr) {
  const products = new Array(arr.length).fill(1);

  let lowerProduct = 1;
  arr.forEach((el, idx) => {
    products[idx] *= lowerProduct;
    lowerProduct *= el;
  });

  let upperProduct = 1;
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    products[i] *= upperProduct;
    upperProduct *= arr[i];
  }

  return products;
}
```
