## Introduction

Tell me about yourself.

*Assume you are applying to Lyft.*

## Epic Fail

What was your biggest failure?

The answer should tell the interviewer the following:

- What was the context for the situation that led to the failure?
- What lead up to the failure?
- What, specifically, was the failure?
- How did you recover from this failure?  What was the eventual outcome?

## `matrix_region_sum`

Given a matrix of integers and the top left and bottom right coordinates of a rectangular region
within the matrix, find the sum of numbers falling inside the rectangle.

Example:
```
# matrix
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 0 1 2

sum_matrix(matrix, [1, 1], [3, 2]) # => 24

**Clarifications:**
- Row/column indices should start at 0
- Row/column indices are inclusive (`sum_matrix(matrix, [1, 2], [3, 2])` will
  include the element at (3, 2)

```ruby
def matrix_region_sum(matrix, top_left_coords, bottom_right_coords)
  total_sum = 0

  (top_left_coords[0]..bottom_right_coords[0]).each do |row_idx|
    (top_left_coords[1]..bottom_right_coords[1]).each do |col_idx|
      total_sum += matrix[row_idx][col_idx]
    end
  end

  total_sum
end
```

```javascript
function matrixRegionSum(matrix, topLeft, bottomRight) {
  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = topLeft[0]; i <= bottomRight[0]; i++) {
    for (let j = topLeft[1]; j <= bottomRight[1]; j++) {
      sum += matrix[i][j];
    }
  }

  return sum;
}
```

## `Delimiter Matching`
Write an algorithm to determine if all of the delimiters in an expression are matched and closed.

**Clarify if asked:**
* Delimiters are `( { [`
* Closed is `()`, `(()` would not be Closed
* Matched is `{}`, `{]` would not be Matched.

**Further examples:**

Would return true:
* `{ac[bb]}`
* `[dklf(df(kl))d]{}`
* `{[[[]]]}`

Would return false:
* `{3234[fd`
* `{df][d}`
* `([)]`

**Hints:**
- What if there was only one delimter to worry about? (just parentheses, for
  example)
- Play with some very basic cases '(', '(', '[]')
- (this hint kinda gives it away) Are there any data structures that might be useful here?

```javascript
function isValid(str) {
  const stack = [];
  const openings = new Set(['{', '[', '(']);
  const closingMap = {
    '}': '{', 
    ']': '[', 
    ')': '('
  };

  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    const letter = str[i];

    if (openings.has(letter)) {
      stack.push(letter);
    }
    else if (closingMap[letter] && stack.pop() != closingMap[letter]) {
      return false
    }
  }
  
  // if stack length > 0, then we have not closed all delimiters
  return stack.length === 0;
}
```
