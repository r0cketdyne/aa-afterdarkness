# Mock Interviewing

## Instructions

* One person takes question set A, the other takes question set B. 
* Alternate between interviewer and interviewee one question at a time.

### Material Review

* Each day will have a material assigned to review
* Take 20 minutes with the project and write down your impressions
  * What stood out as likely to help your partner land a job?
  * What seemed like it could detract from your partner's job search?
* Spend 10 minutes discussing your impressions with each other
  * Feedback is a gift, but don't feel you must implement partner suggestions
 
### Playing the Interviewer

* Present the questions as if doing a real interview. 
* Do not give out an answer, let the interviewee read it later.
* Keep the interviewee on track with leading questions and suggested tips. 
* Make sure you understand the problem you will give your interviewee as well as its solution. 
  * Multiple solutions are valid, but the interviewee must convince you.

### Playing the Interviewee

* Do not ask for an answer. If stumped, talk through problem with the interviewer.
* Always test solutions with inputs and point out edge cases.
* When a solution is found, determine its time complexity and try to optimize.
