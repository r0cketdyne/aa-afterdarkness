# Backbone.CompositeView

A Backbone library that defines a class with utility methods for views
that house other views.

## Dependencies

Backbone.CompositeView requires Underscore version `>= 1.8.0`.
[`backbone-on-rails`][backbone-on-rails] versions after `1.1.2.1`
satisfy this dependency, or you can add `underscore.js` to your
`vendor/assets/javascripts`.

[backbone-on-rails]: https://github.com/meleyal/backbone-on-rails

## Installing

Add `composite_view.js` to your Backbone project. A common place for
this is in a rails app might be
`app/assets/javascripts/utils/composite_view.js`.

Make sure to include the `utils` directory in your `application.js` file
(after `backbone`, but before `views`):
```
//= require backbone
...
//= require_tree ./utils
...
//= require_tree ./views
```

## API

### addSubview (selector, subview, [prepend])
Adds the subview to the parent view's store, calls the subview's
`render` method, and attempts to attach it. The subview can be
prepended, rather than appended, by passing `true` as the optional third
argument.

### attachSubview (selector, subview, [prepend])
Appends the subview to the provided selector, delegating events and
attaching any children. Available for public use, but primarily for use
by `addSubview` and `attachSubviews`.

### attachSubviews
Iterates over the `subviews` object and the contained arrays, attaching
each subview to its selector with `attachSubview`.

### eachSubview (callback)
Iterates over each array of subviews contained in the `subviews` object,
calling `callback` once for each subview. The `callback` is passed two
arguments: the `subview` and its `selector`.

### onRender
Recursively calls `onRender` on all child views. Useful if the behavior
of child views depends on their `$el`s being in the DOM. Child
`CompositeView`s can extend this method:

```js
onRender: function () {
  Backbone.CompositeView.prototype.onRender.call(this);
  // ...
}
```

### remove
Overrides the default implementation to call `remove` on all child
views, ensuring that they can be garbage collected.

### removeSubview (selector, subview)
Calls `remove` on the provided subview and removes it from the `subviews`
object.

### removeModelSubview (selector, model)
Attempts to find a subview matching the provided selector and model. If
found, it will be removed from the DOM and `splice`d out of the
selector's array of `subviews`.

### subviews ([selector])
Reader method that provides access to the `subviews` object. Takes a CSS
selector as an optional argument. If called without a selector, returns
the whole object; if called with a selector, returns the array of views
for that selector. The returned object or array is wrapped with
[Underscore][underscore-js] as a convenience.

### unshiftSubview (selector, subview)
Alias for [`addSubview`](#addsubview-selector-subview-prepend), passing
in `true` for `prepend`.

## Collection Add

+ Write a `addMyView(model)`

```javascript
addPhotoView: function (photo) {
  var subview = new PhotoView({ model: photo });
  this.addSubview('.photos', subview);
}
```

+ In initialize, iterate over the collection, calling `addMyView`.
+ Call `addMyView` on the `add` event of the collection

```javascript
initialize: function () {
  this.listenTo(this.collection, 'add', this.addPhotoView);
  this.collection.each(this.addPhotoView.bind(this));
}
```

+ Call `attachSubviews` in render

```javascript
render: function () {
  var content = this.template();
  this.$el.html(content);
  this.attachSubviews();
  return this;
}
```

---

## Collection Remove

+ Write a `removeMyView(model)`
```javascript
removePhotoView: function (photo) {
  this.removeModelSubview('.photos', photo);
}
```

+ Call `removeMyView` on the `remove` event of the collection
```javascript
initialize: function () {
  this.listenTo(this.collection, 'remove', this.removePhotoView);
}
```
