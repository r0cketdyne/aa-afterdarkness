## Study

### Algos

* [BFS reading and code](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/)

### Web

* [DNS](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-domain-name-system-dns-is-the-backbone-of-the-internet-heres-how-it-all-works-5706d0afa0fa)

### JavaScript

* [Event Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&t)

### Misc

* [React lifecycle methods](https://engineering.musefind.com/react-lifecycle-methods-how-and-when-to-use-them-2111a1b692b1)

### Make Flashcards

* What are the steps for BFS on a graph?
* How does DNS work?
* **UPDATE EXISTING CARD** What's the event loop? How does it work?
* What lifecycle methods get called in the mounting phase? What are the use cases for each of those methods?

## Practice

* Review Anki.

## Code

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more fatures to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
