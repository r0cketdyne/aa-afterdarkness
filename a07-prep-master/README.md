## Assessment07 Practice

### Instructions

You have 1 hour and 15 minutes to write the CSS to make the page look visually identical to the provided design.

There are three images provided of the design: 1. design-final.png 2. design-annotated.png 3. design-outline.png

There is a write up SPECIFICATIONS.md which includes color and type specifications.

A semantically marked up HTML document index.html is provided. Carefully read through this before you start, so you know what you're working with.

Write your solution in the style.css file.

Many CSS selectors are provided for your convenience. You may not need all of them. You may add additional selectors, as you see fit.

HINT: If you choose to float an element, you will need to clear it eventually. In order to do this, you will need to add additional classes to elements in the index.html HTML document. Though many tags have sensible classes provided for you, classes to clear floats have NOT been provided. You must add these by hand.

#### Overlay Helper

There is a small overlay dropdown in the top left corner of index.html. You may use this to show an outline overlay on top of your page to make sure your design lines up correctly. Please use Chrome at 100% zoom level.

You can do it!
