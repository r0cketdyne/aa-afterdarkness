# Assessment07 CSS Instructions

**Do not share this repo or post it publicly. We will take
violations very seriously.**

## Instructions

You have 1 hour and 15 minutes to write the CSS to make the
page look visually identical to the provided design.

There are three images provided of the design:
1. `design-final.png`
2. `design-annotated.png`
3. `design-outline.png`

There is a write up `SPECIFICATIONS.md` which includes
color and type specifications.

A semantically marked up HTML document `index.html` is
provided. Carefully read through this before you start, so
you know what you're working with.

Write your solution in the `style.css` file.

Many CSS selectors are provided for your convenience. You
may not need all of them. You may add additional selectors,
as you see fit.

HINT: If you choose to float an element, you will need to
clear it eventually. In order to do this, you will need to
add additional classes to elements in the `index.html` HTML
document. Though many tags have sensible classes provided
for you, classes to clear floats have NOT been provided.
You must add these by hand.

## Overlay Helper

There is a small overlay dropdown in the top left corner of
`index.html`. You may use this to show an outline overlay
on top of your page to make sure your design lines up
correctly. Please use Chrome at 100% zoom level.

## Submission

After 1 hour and 15 minutes (or upon completion), rename
the `a07` folder to `a07-#{firstname}-#{lastname}`. Then
zip the folder and upload it in the progress tracker.

If you have any problems getting set up and started, ask
your instructors for help.

You can do it!
