# RSpec Workshop
Today we're going to write a few model and controller tests for BenchBnB (woot throwback!) to get a refresher on how to write RSpec tests. In addition, when you first learned how to write RSpec tests, it was in the context of using only Rails as the entire MVC framework, and not necessarily using Rails in conjunction with React.

Today, we'll go over some of the slight differences and also go through one potential way to write controller tests for a Rails backend that's serving up JSON for a React front end.
