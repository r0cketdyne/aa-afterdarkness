# Week 2

## Important Notes about today's Mock Interviews
* Today we will first start with an hour of behavioral mock interviewing and then do an hour of technical mock interviewing.
* For behavioral mock interviews, please get into groups of 4 (try to group up with people you don't know).
* After the hour of behavioral interview, split up into pairs for the technical interview.
* The first technical interview is a whiteboarding question.
* The second technical interview is a practical question done on your laptop.
* **Please be sure to spend 10 minutes studying the problem you are about to administer. Take the time to know your problem well so that you can be an effective and engaged interviewer.**

## Setup for Interview
* Make a copy of [this scorecard][scorecard] **in your own Google drive**
* Get into groups of 4.
* Share edit access of your scorecard with your group.
