# Circle Time Discussion
Take some time to go around the circle and make sure everyone has time to answer all the questions.  Learn, help and support your Circle Partners.  We are all in it together!

* What has been currently working for you on the job search?
* What has been hard for you on the search?
* What are 2 things you could be doing better or need to start doing?
* What advice or tip do you have for your group?
* How do you take care of yourself during the job search?
* What is your favorite dessert?

Please make sure to exchange emails/phone numbers with everyone in your group.  Keep in touch.  Support each other now and in the future.
