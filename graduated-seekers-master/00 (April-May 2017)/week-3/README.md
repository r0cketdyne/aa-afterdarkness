# Week 3

## Important Notes about today's Mock Interviews
* The first interview is more geared towards the front end.
* The second interview is more geared towards the back end.
* **Please be sure to spend 15 minutes studying the problem you are about to administer. Take the time to know your problem well so that you can be an effective and engaged interviewer.**
* No scorecards today- take your own notes throughout the interview and give concrete/detailed feedback.
