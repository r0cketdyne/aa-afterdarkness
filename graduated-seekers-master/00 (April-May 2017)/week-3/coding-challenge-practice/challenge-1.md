### The Coding Challenge

Build an interface that displays tweets by search term. You may want to use the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">public Twitter API</a> for this. At a minimum, users should be able to:

- Search for tweets by keyword or hashtag
- Mark displayed tweets as "favorites" (it's okay if "favorites" don't persist after the user leaves/refreshes the page)

This challenge is untimed, but candidates typically take about 4 hours on this assignment.

### Your Assignment

Come up with a game plan for this assignment. You'll present this shortly to the rest of the group, so make it good!

- Sketch out a user interface. What will the user be able to do? How will the information be displayed?
- Outside APIs can be finicky to use. What would you do in preparation for using this API? What parts of the API do you anticipate using?
- How would you make this project stand out from the crowd? Come up with some interesting "bonus" features, and carefully choose 1-2 of them to include as part of your "MVP" for this challenge.
- Are there any follow-up questions that you'd like to ask the company before you begin?
