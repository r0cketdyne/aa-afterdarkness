# Github Scramble

### The Coding Challenge

This challenge will be a 3-hour timed assignment. You'll be asked to use the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">Github API</a> to display some information on a frontend-only app. The company has asked you to send them a 3-hour block of time that works for you; they'll email you the assignment at the beginning of the block, and you'll turn it in via email at the end of the block.

### Your Assignment

Come up with a preparation plan for this coding challenge by answering the following questions. Imagine that you have ~5 days to prepare (while balancing your other job search commitments, sleeping, eating, etc.). You'll present these to the rest of the group later in this workshop, so your answers should be detailed!  

- What follow-up questions would you want to ask this employer (*before* the challenge, that is)?
- What materials, readings, resources, or solutions would you review or read beforehand?
- What would you do to practice for this? Design a couple coding exercises that are a) good preparation, and b) feasible in the time that you have.
- How would you prepare logistically? Think time, space, internet, food, water, etc.
- Do some disaster prep: what can you foresee coming up that you *wouldn't* be prepared for? Is there anything you can reasonably add to your preparation that would account for this? If so, what? If not, how do you plan to handle an unfamiliar task in the moment?
