# Calendar Craze

### The Coding Challenge

Write a function that takes in a length of time, `n` hours, and an end date, `end_date`, and returns all of the open time slots in the user's calendar. You decide how the calendar and the time slots are stored and represented.

This is an untimed challenge. Candidates typically take 6-8 hours on it.

### Your Assignment

Come up with a plan of attack for this challenge. You'll present this shortly to the rest of the group, so make it good!

- What follow-up questions would you want to ask this employer (*before* the challenge, that is)?
- How will you represent the calendar? How will you display the open time slots that the function returns?
- Will you use a database or not? How would that change your design and approach?
- What kinds of error handling will you need to do? What edge cases can you think of?
- How can you make this project stand out from the crowd? Come up with a list of "bonus" features you'd like to implement, and pick 1-2 that seem feasible to accomplish as part of the MVP.
