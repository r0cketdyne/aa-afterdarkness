# DOM Search

### The Coding Challenge

Create an object that takes in an HTML file and returns all of the headers in that file.

- You can display the headers however you want, but you should include: the type of header (h1, h2,...), its ID, its class list, and its content.
- Optimize for time over space complexity

This is an untimed challenge. Candidates typically take 8-12 hours to complete it.

### Your Assignment

Come up with a plan of attack for this challenge. You'll present this shortly to the rest of the group, so make it good!

- What follow-up questions would you want to ask this employer?
- How will you display the headers? If appropriate, sketch out a user interface.
- What kind of time complexity do you expect from the core functionality? Are there any clear bottlenecks from the start?
- What kinds of error handling will you need to do? What edge cases can you think of?
- How can you make this project stand out from the crowd? Come up with a list of "bonus" features you'd like to implement, and pick 1-2 that seem feasible to accomplish as part of the "MVP".
