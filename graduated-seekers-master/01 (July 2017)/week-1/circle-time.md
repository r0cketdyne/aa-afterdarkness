# Circle Time Discussion
Take some time to go around the circle and make sure everyone has time to answer all the questions. Learn, help and support your Circle Partners.  We are all in it together!

* What has been 2 of your recent challenges while on the job search?
* What has been 2 of your most recent wins?
* How have you been networking over the last month?  What have been your challenges and wins?
* Everybody has good resources.  What is a good resource that you can share with your group?
* How are you taking care of yourself throughout this process?

## Study Buddy
Live practice is the best form of practice! Partner up with someone in your circle and set up a time to meet up (either in person or through skype) for a mock interview (behavioral, technical, or mix) before next week.
