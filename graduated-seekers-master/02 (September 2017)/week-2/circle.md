# Circle Time

Each circle should have 4-5 people only.


One person answers all the following questions (Let one person go through ALL the questions and then go to the next person):

1. What has been some of your biggest challenges applying or interviewing?
2. What are your top two concerns TODAY when it comes to you and the job search?
3. How do you keep yourself motivated and structured each day?
4. What could you do better?
5. When you interview, how do you present yourself as a knowledgeable software developer and not as someone fresh out of school?
