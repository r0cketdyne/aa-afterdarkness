## Pair Programming Problem (35 minutes)

This problem will be a pair-programming problem. Both students will be "interviewees"
in this problem. Switch off between driver and navigator every 5 minutes. Be sure
to set a timer so that you don't forget to switch!

Using vanilla JS and HTML, build a digital clock that displays the current
(west coast; non-military) time.

Notes: 
1. You can only get current time once.
2. You must display hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM.
3. You can only use MDN documentation. 
4. Style it as best as you can within the allotted time.
5. You have 35 minutes to complete this (please set a timer).
6. dateObj.getHours() returns the hour from 0 to 23.
7. Be sure to pad numbers with zeroes on your clock (ie. 02:45:06, not 2:45:6)
8. Be cognizant about testing your code as you go.
9. Bonus: Add an alarm functionality to your clock.

## Debrief (5 minutes)
Debrief with each other and give constructive feedback about the following:
1. Was it easy to follow their thought process when your partner was navigating?
2. Any advice on how to be a better pair programmer?
3. How was their technical fluency?
