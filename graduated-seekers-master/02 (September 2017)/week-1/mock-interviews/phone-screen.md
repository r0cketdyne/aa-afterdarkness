## Interview Questions
1. Tell me a little about yourself.
2. Tell me about some recent challenges you have had on a project and what you did to resolve the challenges?
3. What do you believe are your greatest strengths and weaknesses as a developer?
4. What salary are you looking for?


## Critique Criteria
Evaluate the interviewee on the following:
1. Were they clear and concise?
2. Did they use lots of filler words? Could they have been more loud and animated?
3. Did they sound like they were “experienced” and had good knowledge or did they sound like a  “newbie”? (FOCUS ON THIS CRITERIA)
4. For question about $$$...did they give a dollar value or did they divert as per discussion on NEGOTIATION  (SEE BELOW)
5. What did they do well?
6. What do they need to improve?


## Notes
SALARY QUESTION GOOD ANSWER:  “At this stage it might be too early to discuss this.  However, when we get to that discussion I will be looking towards Glassdoor and Bay area market  and in the end, I am sure we will find a solution that will be a win-win for everyone.”

Remember...If possible, don't throw out a number, but if they press you, throw out a number that doesn't undercut future negotiations, without coming
off as unreasonable.
