# Week 1

## Setup
* Make a copy of [this scorecard][scorecard] **in your own Google drive**
* Find a mock interview partner that you don't know
* Share edit access of your scorecard with that partner.

## Notes
* The scorecard is specifically for the technical interviews (and not the phone screens), but please be sure to follow the evaluation criteria when providing feedback for the mock phone screen.
* The whiteboarding problem from the first interview is a classic interview problem about finding islands.
* Please do the practical problem of the first interview on your laptop and not on the whiteboard.
* The whiteboarding problem from the second interview comes from Leetcode.
* If your partner has seen the problem today already, feel free to substitute the problem with one from the [mock-intervew-meetup repo][mock-interview-meetup-repo].
