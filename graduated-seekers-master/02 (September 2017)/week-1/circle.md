# Circle Time 

**Each circle should have 4 people per group**


One person answers all the following questions (Let one person go through ALL the questions):

1. What has been some of your biggest challenges in your current job search?
2. What have you done for networking besides Meetups?
3. What have been some of your wins?
4. What 2 things will you do more of to improve your job search this week?

**Once every person in your group has gone, match up with one other person to be their accountability partner for this week. Check in with this person on whether or not they followed through with their plan for improving their job search. In addition, meet up (either in person or through Skype) to do a mock interview together.**
